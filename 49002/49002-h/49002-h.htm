<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">“IN TEXAS DOWN ON THE RIO GRANDE.”</p>

<p>“Yip! Yip! Y&ndash;e&ndash;e&ndash;e&ndash;e&ndash;ow!”</p>

<p>“Gracious! What’s coming, a band of circus
Indians?”</p>

<p>“Not knowing, can’t say; but there is evidently
something to the fore in the strenuous
line.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say so. Hark, what’s that?”</p>

<p>“Shooting; maybe some of those Mestizos
from over the Rio Grande are attacking the
town.”</p>

<p>“Hardly likely. The last heard of them they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
were fifty miles from the Border fighting hard
with the Federals. But it’s something, all right.”</p>

<p>“Hullo! Look there. It’s&mdash;it’s the Rangers!”</p>

<p>The red&ndash;headed, sun&ndash;burned last speaker reined
in his impetuous, plunging, gray broncho and,
shielding his eyes with his hand, gazed down
the dusty main street of San Mercedes. Above
the trio of lads who had halted their cayuses at
the sudden sound of distant uproar, the sun hung
in the steely blue sky like a red hot copper ball.
Jack Merrill, alert and good&ndash;looking, with his
frank, bronzed face and easy seat in the saddle,
followed the direction of red&ndash;headed Walt
Phelps’ gaze. Ralph Stetson, equally excited,
studied the situation with equivalent interest.</p>

<p>And now at the end of the street, which
had suddenly become thronged as if by magic
with slouching Mexicans, blue&ndash;bloused Chinese
and swinging&ndash;gaited cow&ndash;punchers with jingling
spurs on their high&ndash;heeled boots, a novel procession
swept into view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of a cloud of yellow dust, which hung
like a saffron curtain against the burning cobalt
of the sky, appeared the foremost of a group
of riders.</p>

<p>“Here they come! Look out, fellows! Let’s
sidetrack ourselves and let the Texas limited
go by!”</p>

<p>As he shouted this advice Ralph Stetson, a
lad of slightly more delicate build than his youthful
companions, swung his wiry little pony in
a pivotal sweep, and made as if to retreat.</p>

<p>“Hurry, boys!” he shouted.</p>

<p>But Jack Merrill stood his ground, and Walt
Phelps, seeing that the leader of the three Border
Boys did not swerve in the face of the onrush,
did not budge an inch either. But on the
street excitement was rife. Cayuses, hitched to
the long, strong hitching racks, or simply left to
stand with the reins dropped to the ground over
their heads, plunged and squealed. Men ran
about and shouted, and even the usually stolid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Chinese restaurant keepers and laundry men
seemed stirred out of their habitual state of
supreme unconcern. As for the Mexican residents
of San Mercedes, they merely drew their
serapes closer about them and from beneath
their broad brimmed, cone&ndash;crowned sombreros
gazed with a haughty indifference at the group
of galloping, shouting horsemen.</p>

<p>As Ralph Stetson cantered off, Jack Merrill
backed his pony up to the very edge of the raised
wooden sidewalk. The little animal was wildly
excited and plunged and whinnied as if it felt the
bit and saddle for the first time. But Jack maintained
his easy, graceful seat as if he had formed
part of the lively little creature he bestrode.
Walt Phelps, also undisturbed, controlled his
equally restive mount.</p>

<p>“Why don’t we cut and run, too, Jack?” asked
Walt, as the hind feet of their ponies rattled
on the wooden walk. “Those fellows are taking
up the whole street. They’ll run us down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Inasmuch as they are just the men that we
are here to meet,” responded Jack, “I propose
to stand my ground.”</p>

<p>The Border Boys had arrived in San Mercedes
that morning, having ridden from El Chico, the
nearest town on the Southern Pacific Railroad.
They had come almost directly from a short rest
following their exciting adventures across the
Mexican Border, as related in “The Border Boys
With the Mexican Rangers.” In this book, it
will be recalled, they had aided the picturesque
mounted police of Mexico in running down a
band of desperadoes headed by Black Ramon, a
famous Border character.</p>

<p>We first met the boys in the initial book of this
series, “The Border Boys on the Trail.” This
volume set forth how Jack Merrill, the son of an
Arizona rancher, and Ralph Stetson, the rather
delicate son of an Eastern Railroad magnate and
an old school chum, had shared with Walt Phelps,
a cattleman’s son, some astonishing adventures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
including much trouble with the hard characters
who formed the nucleus of a band of cattle rustlers.
They assisted in putting them to rout, but
not before they had encountered many stirring
adventures in a ruined mission church in Chihuahua
used as a gathering place by the band. The
treasure they discovered secreted in the catacombs
under the ruined edifice had given each
boy a substantial little nest egg of his own.</p>

<p>In “The Border Boys Across the Frontier”
they were found aiding Uncle Sam. They happened
to find a strange subterranean river by
means of which arms and ammunition were being
smuggled to Mexican revolutionists. In trying
to put a stop to that work they were captured,
and escaped only after a ride on a borrowed locomotive
and a fight in the stockade of the Esmeralda
mine.</p>

<p>We now find them in San Mercedes awaiting
the arrival of the Texas Rangers, a detachment
of whom had been ordered to the little settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
on the banks of the Rio Grande Del Norte to put
down any disturbances, and to keep the warring
Mexicans from committing outrages on Uncle
Sam’s soil. The boys, always anxious for anything
that might offer in the way of adventure,
had begged their fathers to allow them to see
something of the work of the Rangers. At first
this had been absolutely refused. But finally Mr.
Stetson gave his permission, and then Mr. Merrill
fell in line, as did Walt Phelps’ parents. Captain
Moseby Atkinson of the Rangers being an
old friend of Mr. Merrill’s, the rest was easy,
and it had been arranged that the boys were
to meet Captain Atkinson at San Mercedes.
Though they looked only for fun and novel experiences,
the Border Boys were destined, while
with the Rangers, to pass through adventures
more thrilling, and hardships more severe than
they dreamed.</p>

<p>On dashed the Rangers, the hoofs of their
mounts thundering like artillery. It was a sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
calculated to stir the heart and quicken the pulse
of any wholesome, active lad. There were fully
twenty of them, riding six abreast. Their sombreros,
blue shirts, rough leather chaps and the
rifles slung in each man’s saddle holster, showed
them to be men of action in the acutest sense of
that word; men whose bronzed faces and keen,
steady eyes bespoke them of the best type of
plainsman; worthy descendants of Fremont,
Lewis and Clarke.</p>

<p>“Yip! Yip!” the foremost of the riders
shouted as they saw the boys.</p>

<p>Jack’s fiery little pony began to show signs of
frantic alarm. It bucked and tried to throw itself
backward, but each time the young horseman’s
skill checked it.</p>

<p>“Captain! Captain!” called Jack, as the Rangers
swept by.</p>

<p>But above the thunder of hoofs, and in the
midst of the yellow dust clouds, Captain Atkinson
did not hear nor see the two boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>But one of his men, a rather squat, dark&ndash;skinned,
dark&ndash;haired little fellow, did.</p>

<p>“Y&mdash;e&mdash;ow! Out of the way, you tenderfoot
kid!” he exploded.</p>

<p>“I’m trying to get out of the way,” responded
Jack good humoredly.</p>

<p>“What’s that, you long&ndash;legged cayuse,” bellowed
the little chap, whose sleeves were tied
round above the elbows with gorgeous pink ribbons,
and whose black silk shirt was embroidered
with pink rosebuds, “what’s that? Can you ride,
kid? Can you ride?”</p>

<p>At the same instant Jack’s pony swung around,
presenting its flank toward the little Ranger. As
it did so the Texan brought down his quirt with
all its force on the startled little creature’s rump.</p>

<p>“Wow! now for fireworks!” he shouted, while
his comrades checked their ponies to see the fun.</p>

<p>Jack said nothing. In truth, he had his hands
full. Excited before, his pony was now half
mad with frenzy. It bucked as if its insides had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
been made of steel springs. But Jack stuck to
it like a burr to a maverick’s tail.</p>

<p>“Wow! Wow!” shouted the Rangers, as the
pony gathered its feet together, sprung into the
air, and came down with legs as stiff as hitching
posts.</p>

<p>“Stick to him, kid! Don’t go to leather!”
(meaning, “grab hold of the saddle”), encouraged
some of the Rangers struck by Jack’s manful
riding. But the dark&ndash;skinned little chap
seemed to wish nothing more than to see the
youthful leader of the Border Boys ignominiously
toppled into the dust. He spurred his pony
alongside Jack’s and whacked it again and again
with his rawhide quirt.</p>

<p>“That’s enough!” shouted Jack. “Stop it!”</p>

<p>“You’re scared!” jeered the Ranger.
“Mammy’s little pet!”</p>

<p>The taunt had hardly left his lips before
something very unexpected happened. Jack, for
a flash, managed to secure control of his pony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
He swung it round on its hind legs and rode it
right at the scornful, jeering Ranger. As he
did so the other leaned out of his saddle to give
Jack’s pony another blow with the quirt as it
dashed by him. But he miscalculated. Jack
drove his pony right in alongside his tormentor’s,
and the shock of the collision, added to the position
the Ranger now occupied in the saddle&mdash;leaning
far over&mdash;proved too much for his equilibrium.</p>

<p>His animal plunged, as if shot from a catapult,
halfway across the street from Jack’s pony. As
it did so its rider made a vain attempt to save
himself by grabbing its withers. But quick as
he was he could not regain his balance.</p>

<p>Off he shot, landing in the street and ploughing
a furrow with his face in the soft dust. As
for the pony, it dashed off, while a dozen Rangers
pursued it, yelling and swinging lariats.</p>

<p>Those who remained set up a yell of delight.
It tickled the fancy of these free and easy sons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the plains to see their companion unhorsed by
a slip of a boy.</p>

<p>“Good for you, kid!” shouted some.</p>

<p>“Say, Shorty,” admonished others, “why don’t
you pick a fellow your own size?”</p>

<p>In the meantime “Shorty,” as he had been addressed,
scrambled to his feet. He was a sorry
object. His elaborate black silk shirt was torn
and dust covered, and one of his carefully tied
ribbons was missing. His sombrero lay six feet
away, and his black hair fell in a tangle over his
dark forehead. As he got to his legs again,
crowning humiliation of all, a Chinaman picked
up his broad&ndash;brimmed hat and tendered it to
him. Shorty aimed a blow and a curse at the
well&ndash;meaning Mongolian, who quickly dodged.</p>

<p>With a roar of rage he rushed at Jack. Then
Jack and the others saw what they had not noticed
before.</p>

<p>In his fall Shorty’s revolver had fallen from
its holster into the dust. But he had recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
it, and now, with his lips set viciously, he was
rushing at Jack, the weapon poised for a shot.</p>

<p>“You dern young coyote, I’ll do fer you!” he
shouted hoarsely, beside himself with fury, intensified
by the taunts of his companions over
his downfall.</p>

<p>As if in a trance Jack saw the revolver raised
above the fellow’s head, and then brought down
to the firing position.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HUMBLING OF SHORTY.</p>

<p>But at the very instant that the Ranger’s finger
pressed the trigger something came swishing and
snaking through the air, falling in a loop about
him and pinioning his arms. The gun cracked as
Shorty was yanked from his feet, but the bullet
merely ploughed a little furrow in the ground.
The next minute he was rolling in the dust for
the second time, roped as neatly as ever he had
lassoed a yearling, by the rawhide of Captain
Atkinson himself.</p>

<p>The captain, who had been in advance, as we
know, had not witnessed the first part of the
drama which had so nearly ended in a tragedy,
but had been apprised of it when Shorty’s pinto
pony had flashed by him with half a dozen shouting
Rangers at its heels. The minute it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
roped he instituted inquiries, and hearing what
had occurred, he judged from his acquaintance
with Shorty’s character that his presence might
be needed at the scene of the Ranger’s unhorsing.</p>

<p>At top speed he had galloped back, arriving
just in time to see Shorty’s revolver flash in the
air as he brought it down for a shot. Almost
as by magic the captain’s hand had sought and
found his lariat and sent its coil swishing through
the air.</p>

<p>“Get up!” he thundered to the disgruntled
Shorty, who, thoroughly humiliated, did as he
was told.</p>

<p>“Let me alone! Let me git at that cub!” he
snarled, under his breath.</p>

<p>“See here, Shorty Swift!” flashed Atkinson,
“this isn’t the first trouble I’ve had with you.
You’re a disgrace to the Rangers.”</p>

<p>“He was pickin’ on me,” began the Ranger;
but his commander cut him short with a sharp
word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Buncombe! Is this the way you obey orders
to conduct yourself properly? Do you mean to
tell me that you can give me any good reason why
a kid like that should annoy a Texas ranger?”</p>

<p>“Well, he did. It was his fault. He&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“See here, Shorty, are you going to tell the
truth?”</p>

<p>“I am telling the truth, cap.”</p>

<p>“You’re not. Some of you other boys tell me
what happened.”</p>

<p>One of the Rangers who had applauded Jack’s
horsemanship gave a plain, unvarnished account
of the whole scene. Captain Atkinson’s brow
darkened as he heard.</p>

<p>“So,” he snapped, “that’s the sort of fellow you
are. Well, all I’ve got to say is that you and
your kind are a disgrace to the name of Texas.
I’ve warned you before, Shorty, of what you
might expect if you got into disgrace again.
That was the last time. Now I find you bullyin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>’
a kid who hadn’t done you any harm, and when
he gave you what you deserved you tried to
shoot him. I’ve only got one thing to say to
you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>There was a vibrant silence, during which the
trampling of the restless ponies’ hoofs and the
hard breathing of Shorty were the only sounds
to break the stillness.</p>

<p>“Git!”</p>

<p>The order came like the crack of a rifle.</p>

<p>Shorty seemed to wither and grow smaller
and darker as he heard.</p>

<p>“Captain, I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;” he stammered out. But Atkinson
cut him short abruptly.</p>

<p>“You heard me. Git! This isn’t a cow camp,
but a regularly organized troop to enforce law
and order. You set a fine example of lawlessness
right in the town we have been sent to protect
from that very thing. There’s your pony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and here’s the pay that’s coming to you. Hit
the trail, and hit it quick.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too hard on him, captain. Give him
one more chance. I guess it was only meant as
horse play and not viciousness.”</p>

<p>Captain Atkinson turned his bronzed countenance
on the speaker. It was Jack. Beside
him Walt Phelps had reined up and Ralph Stetson,
too, the latter having been attracted by the
excitement from the side street where he had
sought refuge at the boisterous entrance of the
Rangers.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” he said. “Well, young
chap, you’ve got nerve and sense; but this fellow
doesn’t deserve any pity.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he won’t do it again,” Jack assured
the captain; “let him off this time. He’s been
punished enough.”</p>

<p>At this Captain Atkinson could not resist a
smile. Shorty’s woebegone appearance assuredly
bore testimony to the truth of Jack’s statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the Rangers, some of them broke into
an open guffaw of amusement.</p>

<p>“You’re sure right, young chap,” agreed Captain
Atkinson, “but right now I’d like to ask you
who you and your two friends are. You don’t
look as if you belonged about here.”</p>

<p>“We don’t. My name is Jack Merrill, this is
Walt Phelps and yonder is Ralph Stetson, a
school chum and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Waal, by the Lone Star! So you’re the kids
I’m to take along, eh? Shake, boy, shake! I
thought you were a lot of blithering tenderfeet,
but you’re regular punchers. Put it there, Jack.
I’m Captain Atkinson, your father’s friend,
and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I guessed as much,” smiled Jack, shaking
hands with the grizzled leader of the Rangers
who, in turn, almost wrung the lad’s fingers off.
“It’s for the sake of your friendship, captain,
that I ask you to give this man another chance.”</p>

<p>“Boy, you’re a real sport. Shorty, apologize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to this lad here and take your place in the ranks.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m sorry,” muttered Shorty, hanging his
head sullenly and forcing the words from unwilling
lips.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Shorty,” said Jack heartily,
“and I’m as sorry as you are. I didn’t mean to
give you such a bump.”</p>

<p>Shorty took the outstretched hand with limp
fingers, barely touched it, and then, remounting
his pony, which had been led up, rode off to the
rear of his comrades. His face was contorted
with humiliation and angry shame.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t judge the Rangers by that
fellow,” said Captain Atkinson to Jack when
Shorty had gone; “we may appear rough but
our hearts are in the right place, as I hope we
shall prove to you.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” rejoined Jack heartily. “Are
we going to camp far from the town?” he asked,
by way of changing the subject.</p>

<p>“Yes, in the outskirts, on the banks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
river. Alameda and his men are giving the Federal
troops a hard tussle, and we want to be on
the job if they try to cross.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t be in one place?”</p>

<p>Captain Atkinson laughed.</p>

<p>“No; we Rangers are supposed to be like the
Irish bird that flew in two places at the same
time,” he said.</p>

<p>Then, in a more serious tone, he went on:</p>

<p>“We have twenty&ndash;five miles of the Rio Grande
to patrol and see that the life and property of
Americans along the Border are protected. It is
also our duty to keep the revolutionists or Federals
from getting into American territory or
receiving supplies.”</p>

<p>“We had some experience in that line when
we were in Northern Chihuahua,” responded
Jack.</p>

<p>“So I have heard. That is one reason I consented
to have you along. Raw tenderfoots
would be out of place on a job of this kind. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
now we must be pushing on. I want to get into
camp and map out my plan of campaign before
night.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the column was reformed,
and the Rangers, at an easy pace, were riding out
of the town toward the river. The three boys
rode together.</p>

<p>“Well, Jack,” remarked Ralph Stetson, as soon
as they found themselves alone, “you’ve made a
nice mess of it.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” inquired Jack unsuspiciously.</p>

<p>“Getting in a muss with that Ranger. From
the look he gave you as he went away I could
see he bore you no great affection.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to lose any sleep over it,”
declared Jack.</p>

<p>“I should think not,” chimed in Walt Phelps,
“you only did what you were compelled to do.
My dad says, ‘Don’t go looking for trouble and
always avoid it if you can; but if you have it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
forced on you, why then make the other fellow
remember it.’”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that Shorty not remembering
it,” admonished Ralph seriously; “he’s not
of the forgetting kind.”</p>

<p>And Ralph was right&mdash;Shorty wasn’t, as we
shall see before long.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN ATTEMPT AT “GETTING EVEN.”</p>

<p>The Rangers, still overshadowed by that pall
of yellow dust that seemed inseparable from
them, and almost as much a part of themselves
as their horses or accouterments, dashed gallantly
out of the town and across the rather
dreary expanse of mesquite and thorny cactus
that lay between San Mercedes and the Rio
Grande. On the brink of the stream, which at
that point flowed between steep bluffs of a reddish
hue, they drew rein.</p>

<p>The boys peered curiously over the bluff on
the edge of which they had halted. They saw
a shallow, slowly flowing stream obstructed with
sand bars and shallows. On its banks grew
scanty patches of brush and dull&ndash;colored, stunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
trees; but the scene was a dreary, almost melancholy
one.</p>

<p>“So this is the Rio Grande!” exclaimed Ralph,
in a disappointed voice, “I always thought of it
as a noble river dashing along between steep
banks and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Gracious, you talk like Sir Walter Scott,”
grinned Jack; “the Rio Grande at this time of
the year, so I’ve been told, is always like this.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s not much more than a mud puddle,”
complained Walt Phelps.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that, young men,” put
in Captain Atkinson, who had overheard their
conversation, “at certain times in the early
spring, or winter you’d call it back east, or when
there is a cloud burst, the old Rio can be as angry
as the best of them.”</p>

<p>“What’s a cloud burst?” asked Ralph curiously.
“I’ve read of them but I never knew just
what they were.”</p>

<p>“Well, for a scientific explanation you’ll have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to ask somebody wiser than me,” laughed Captain
Atkinson, “but for an everyday explanation,
a cloud burst occurs when clouds, full of moisture,
come in contact with mountain tops warmer
than the clouds themselves. This causes the
clouds to melt all at once&mdash;precipitation, I believe
the weather sharps call it&mdash;and then if you are
in this part of the country, look out for squalls
along the river.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t quite understand,” remarked
Walt. “I guess I’m dense or something. I mean
there are no mountains here.”</p>

<p>“No; but up among the sources of the Rio
there are,” explained the leader of the Rangers,
“and a cloud burst even many hundred miles
away means a sudden tidal wave along this part
of the Rio.”</p>

<p>“Well, it certainly looks as if it could stand
quite a lot more water without being particularly
dangerous,” commented Jack.</p>

<p>At this point of the conversation Captain Atkinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
gave a quick look around as the rumble
of approaching wheels was heard.</p>

<p>“Here comes the chuck&ndash;wagon, I guess,” he
said; “you boys will have to excuse me while I
ride off to tell them where to make a pitch.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I suppose a chuck wagon naturally
would make a pitch,” grinned Ralph, as Captain
Atkinson clattered off.</p>

<p>“The kind of pitch he means is a location,”
rejoined Walt Phelps. “Look, boys! there she
comes. Well, that means that we don’t starve,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>The others followed the direction of Walt’s
gaze and saw a big lumbering vehicle drawn by
eight mules approaching across the mesquite
plain. It was roofed with canvas, and through
this roof stuck a rusty iron stove pipe. From
this blue smoke was pouring in a cloud.</p>

<p>“Talk about a prairie schooner. I guess that’s
a prairie steamer. Look at her smoke&ndash;stack,”
cried Ralph.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; and look at the captain,” laughed Jack,
pointing to the yellow face and flying queue of
a Chinaman, which were at this moment projected
from the back of the wagon.</p>

<p>“That’s the cook,” said Walt Phelps, “I guess
he’s been getting supper ready as they came
along.”</p>

<p>A loud cheer went up from the Rangers as
their traveling dining&ndash;room came into sight.</p>

<p>“Hello, old Sawed Off, how’s chuck?” yelled
one Ranger at the grinning Chinaman.</p>

<p>“Hey, there! What’s the news from the Chinese
Republic?” shouted another.</p>

<p>“Me no Chinese ‘public. Me Chinese Democlat!”
bawled the yellow man, waving an iron
spoon and vanishing into the interior of his
wheeled domain.</p>

<p>“They call him Sawed Off because his name
is Tuo Long,” chuckled Captain Atkinson, when
he had directed the driver of the cook wagon
where to draw up and unharness his mules, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
he’s a mighty good cook&mdash;none better, in fact.
He’s only got one failing, if you can call it such,
and that is his dislike of the new Chinese Republic.
If you want to get him excited you’ve
only to start him on that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t much believe in getting cooks angry,”
announced Walt Phelps, whose appetite was always
a source of merriment with the Border
Boys.</p>

<p>“Nor I. But come along and get acquainted
with the boys. By&ndash;the&ndash;way, you brought blankets
and slickers as I wrote you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and canteens, too. In fact, I guess
we are all prepared to be regular Rangers,”
smiled Jack.</p>

<p>By this time the camp was a scene of picturesque
bustle. Ponies had been unsaddled and
tethered, and presently another wagon, loaded
with baled hay in a great yellow stack, came
rumbling up. The Rangers, who had by this
time selected their sleeping places and bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
their saddles, at once set about giving their active
little mounts their suppers.</p>

<p>First, each man mounted on his pony barebacked
and rode it down to the river to get a
drink of water. To do this they had to ride some
little distance, as the bluffs at that point were
steep and no path offered. At last, however, a
trail was found, and in single file down they
went to the watering place.</p>

<p>The boys followed the rest along the steep
path, Jack coming last of the trio. The trail lay
along the edge of the bluff, and at some places
was not much wider than a man’s hand. Jack
had reached the worst part of it, where a drop
of some hundred feet lay below him, when he
was astonished to hear the sound of hoofs behind
him.</p>

<p>He was astonished because, he had judged,
almost everybody in the camp had preceded him
while he had been busy inspecting the different
arrangements. He faced round abruptly in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
saddle and saw that the rider behind him was
Shorty.</p>

<p>It must have been at almost the same moment
that, for some unknown reason, Shorty’s horse
began to plunge and kick. Then it dashed forward,
bearing down directly on Jack.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shouted Jack, “there’s only room
for one on the trail. You’ll knock me off!”</p>

<p>“I can’t pull him in! I can’t pull him in!”
yelled Shorty, making what appeared to be frantic
efforts to pull in his pony. At the same time
he kept the cayuse to the inside of the trail.</p>

<p>Jack saw that unless he did something, and
quickly, too, his pony was likely to become unmanageable
and plunge off the narrow path. But
there was small choice of remedies. Already
Shorty’s horse, which was coming as if maddened
by something, was dashing down on him.
Jack resolved to take a desperate chance. The
others had by this time almost reached the bottom
of the trail. As fast as he dared he compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
his pony to gallop down the steep incline.
It was a dangerous thing to do, for the trail was
too narrow to afford any foothold at more than
a slow and careful walk.</p>

<p>Behind him, yelling like one possessed, came
Shorty. Jack urged his mount faster.</p>

<p>“Goodness! I hope we get to the bottom
safely!” he gasped out.</p>

<p>The words had hardly left his lips when he felt
his pony’s hoofs slip from under him.</p>

<p>The next instant, amid a horrified shout from
the men below, Jack and the pony went rolling
and plunging off the trail down toward the river.</p>

<p>The last sound Jack heard was Shorty’s loud:</p>

<p>“Yip! yip! Ye&ndash;o&ndash;o&ndash;ow!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">WITH THE RANGERS.</p>

<p>From below, where Jack’s companions had witnessed
his fall with horrified eyes, it appeared
almost impossible that he could escape without
serious injury. But as his pony struck the
ground at the foot of the cliff, amidst a regular
landslide of twigs, rocks and earth, Jack succeeded
in extricating himself from under the
animal, and rolling a few yards he scrambled
to his feet, unhurt except for a few slight cuts
and bruises.</p>

<p>Ralph and Walt Phelps left their ponies and
came running up to where Jack stood brushing
the dirt from his garments.</p>

<p>“Hurt, Jack?” cried Ralph.</p>

<p>“No; never touched me,” laughed the boy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
“and look at that cayuse of mine, I guess he isn’t
injured, either.”</p>

<p>As Jack spoke he nodded his head in the direction
of his pony, which had risen and was now
galloping off to join its companions at the watering
place.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” demanded Walt. “We
saw you coming down the trail quietly enough
one moment, and at the next look, behold, you
were riding like Tam o’ Shanter.”</p>

<p>Jack looked about him before replying. But
he and his companions were alone, for the Rangers
were too busy watering their mounts to
bother with the boys once it had been seen that
Jack was not hurt.</p>

<p>“I guess you were right when you said that
Shorty had it in for me,” he remarked, turning
to Walt Phelps.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just this: Shorty was behind me on that
trail. Suddenly his pony began to bolt. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to avoid being forced from the narrow path that
I spurred up my cayuse so as to keep ahead of
him.”</p>

<p>“What do you think he meant to do?”</p>

<p>The question came from Ralph.</p>

<p>“It’s my opinion that he deliberately tried to
get between me and the wall of the cliff and
force me off the trail.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! You might have been killed.”</p>

<p>“Not much doubt that I’d have been badly injured,
anyway. But Shorty miscalculated, and
where I left the trail was further on and not so
far to fall.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell Captain Atkinson?”</p>

<p>“Why, I have nothing to prove that Shorty’s
pony really didn’t get beyond his control.”</p>

<p>“Then you suspect that it was not really running
away, but that he made it appear that he
was unable to manage it?”</p>

<p>“That’s it exactly. However, let’s join the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
men. If I get a chance I want to examine
Shorty’s horse.”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea in that?” asked Walt.</p>

<p>“You’ll see what my plan is if I get an opportunity
to put it into execution,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The three boys, arm in arm, sauntered up to
the group of Rangers. Some of them were now
remounted, and two men had charge of the boys’
ponies, including Jack’s, which had joined its
comrades. Shorty was still watering his animal,
but when he saw the boys he came up to
Jack with an outstretched hand, and every appearance
of great affability.</p>

<p>“Say, Pard’ner,” he exclaimed, as if genuinely
remorseful, “I hope you ain’t mad with me
on ’count of that accident.”</p>

<p>“No; I never harbor a grudge,” responded
Jack, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“That critter of mine jes’ nat’ly ran away from
me,” pursued Shorty, in the same tone.</p>

<p>“And so that’s the reason you had to spur him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
till he bled,” flashed Jack, in a low tone. The
boy had seized his opportunity to look over
Shorty’s pony and saw at once that it had been
cruelly rowelled.</p>

<p>Shorty went pale under his tan. His mouth
twitched nervously.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, you ain’t goin’ for to say I done
it a&ndash;purpose?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I’m not saying anything about it,” responded
Jack; “all that I know is this, that I shall take
care how I ride in front of you again.”</p>

<p>So saying the boy turned on his heel and
walked toward his pony, followed by Walt and
Ralph, who had witnessed the whole scene.
Shorty gazed after them. His alarm had gone
from his countenance now, and he bore an expression
of malignant rage.</p>

<p>“Dern young tenderfoot cubs,” he growled to
himself, relieving his feelings by giving his pony
a kick in the stomach, “blamed interferin’
Mammy boys! I’ll l’arn ‘em a lesson yet. I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
jes’ bet I will, and it’ll be a hot one, too. One
they won’t forget in a hurry.”</p>

<p>But of Shorty’s fury the boys were ignorant,
for they quickly mounted and clattered back up
the trail with the rest of the Rangers. On their
return to the camp, as soon as each little pony
had been given his generous allowance of hay,
they found that supper was ready, the Chinaman
announcing the fact by beating on a tin dishpan
and shouting:</p>

<p>“Come getee! Come getee!”</p>

<p>None of the Rangers needed any second invitation;
nor did the boys need any pressing to
make hearty meals. Bacon, salted beef, beans,
hot biscuits and strong coffee formed the bill of
fare. After the meal had been dispatched Captain
Atkinson beckoned to Jack and his companions,
and they followed him a little apart from
the rest of the Rangers who were singing songs
and telling stories around a big camp fire, for
the night was quite chilly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Since you lads have joined us to learn all you
can of the life of a Texas Ranger,” he said, “I
think that you had better start in as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Right away if necessary,” responded Jack
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“That’s my idea,” struck in Walt Phelps.</p>

<p>“Can’t make it too soon for me, captain,”
added Ralph, not a whit less eager than the
others.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” smiled the captain of the
Rangers, “you will go on sentry duty to&ndash;night,
and to&ndash;morrow I shall see that you have some
other work assigned to you.”</p>

<p>“Do we&mdash;do we have to do sentry duty all
night?” asked Ralph, in a rather dubious tone.</p>

<p>“No, indeed. That would never do. You
must get your sleep. For that reason we divide
the hours of darkness into regular watches.
There are four of these. I shall assign you to
go out with the first guard,” said Captain Atkinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to Jack, and then in turn he informed Walt
Phelps and Ralph Stetson that their assignments
would come with the second and third watches
respectively.</p>

<p>Jack was all eagerness to begin, and when at
eight o’clock he and six of the Rangers rode out
of the camp toward the river his heart throbbed
with anticipation of the duty before him. The
men were in charge of one of their number
named “Baldy” Sears. This Baldy was quite a
character and had determined to give Jack a
thorough testing out. As they rode out, the boy
questioned “Baldy” eagerly about his duties, but
didn’t get much satisfaction.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Baldy entertained quite a
contempt for “Tenderfeet,” as he called the boys,
and was rather annoyed at having to take Jack
out and act as “school marm,” as he phrased it.</p>

<p>They reached the river by the same trail that
they had descended to water their ponies earlier
that evening. As it was still dusk they rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
down it without accident. In fact, the Rangers
hardly appeared to notice its dangers. Jack,
however, wondered how it would be possible to
descend it in the dark without mishap. But,
then, he recollected the sure&ndash;footedness and uncommon
intelligence of the average western pony,
and realized that if given a loose rein, there
probably was not a cayuse in the outfit that could
not negotiate it without difficulty.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said Baldy, when they reached
the bottom of the path, “line up and I’ll give you
your orders. You, Red Saunders, ride east with
Sam, and Ed. Ricky, you and Big Foot ride to
the west and keep patrolling. I’ll take the young
maverick here with me. If any of you gets in
trouble or wants assistance fire three shots. I
reckon that’s all.”</p>

<p>The men rode off into the night, and then
Baldy and Jack were left alone.</p>

<p>“Got a shootin’ iron with you, young feller?”
inquired Baldy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“A what?” returned Jack.</p>

<p>“Waal, if you ain’t the tenderfootedest of tenderfeets,”
scoffed Baldy; “a shootin’ iron&mdash;a
gun!”</p>

<p>“Why, no, I didn’t think it necessary to bring
one,” rejoined Jack. “I don’t like carrying firearms
unless they are needful. Do you think that
anything will happen in which firearms would
be useful?”</p>

<p>“Firearms is always useful along the Rio,”
returned Baldy, “I dunno if the cap told you, but
we’re here on special duty to&ndash;night.”</p>

<p>“Dangerous duty?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“You can’t most gen’ally sometimes allers
tell,” vouchsafed Baldy, examining the magazine
of his rifle which he had taken from its saddle
holster for the purpose.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">JACK’S CHANCE.</p>

<p>“You mean that there is a chance of our being
attacked?”</p>

<p>Jack put the question in rather an anxious
tone. But for some reason Baldy only grunted
in reply.</p>

<p>“I’m going back to camp to git you a gun,” he
said; “you stay right here till I get back.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Baldy,” rejoined the boy, in
as conciliatory a tone as possible.</p>

<p>“Don’t mister me. I ain’t got no handle to my
name and don’t never expect to have,” grunted
Baldy, as he swung his pony and rode off.</p>

<p>As Jack listened to the retreating hoof beats
he felt strangely lonely. It was very dark down
in the cañon, and the steely blue stars seemed
very far away. Only the rushing of the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the river disturbed the boy’s thoughts while
he awaited Baldy’s return.</p>

<p>“He’s not very lively company,” he admitted
to himself, “but it’s better than being all alone.
Wish Ralph or Walt had been ordered to share
my watch.”</p>

<p>But the next moment he was scolding himself.</p>

<p>“For shame, Jack Merrill,” he said, “here’s the
first bit of duty you’ve been put to, and here you
are complaining already. It’s got to stop right
here and now, and&mdash;hello, what was that?”</p>

<p>The boy broke off short, as through the darkness
of the cañon he caught an odd sound from
the river.</p>

<p>“What can that sound be?” he said to himself.
“It seems familiar, too. Where have I heard
something like it before?”</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden it dawned upon him what
the odd noise was.</p>

<p>It was the splash of oars. But what could a
boat be doing on the river at that time of night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and in such a place? Jack was asking himself
these questions when he became aware of some
words being spoken at a short distance from
him. He recognized the language instantly.
The men who were conversing were talking in
Spanish, of which tongue Jack had a fair working
knowledge, as we know.</p>

<p>He was in the darker shadow of the cañon
wall and therefore, of course, quite invisible to
whoever was on the river, and who had apparently
come to a stop almost opposite to his station.
He quickly slipped from his pony, and
taking advantage of the brush that grew almost
to the water’s edge, he crawled along on his
stomach in the direction of the unseen men.</p>

<p>At last he gained a position where he could
hear them quite distinctly, and could even see
their figures bulking up blackly in the general
gloom. But what they were doing he could not
imagine, and when he finally did find out he received
the surprise of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Listening to their talk, Jack heard them speaking
of Rosario, the leader of the insurgents in
that quarter of the Mexican Republic, and apparently
they were discussing some mission on
which they had been dispatched.</p>

<p>He heard the Rangers mentioned, and then
came some information that was new to him.
The Federal troops of Mexico were hot on the
heels of the insurgent army, and the rebels were
planning to bring the coming battle on to American
soil if possible, in order to force the interference
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>Evidently the men knew of the presence of
the Rangers in the locality, and, by listening,
Jack soon learned that they were there acting as
spies in order to find out how strongly the Border
was guarded at that point. Finally they
strode off cautiously into the darkness, apparently
with the object of reconnoitering the vicinity.</p>

<p>This was Jack’s chance. Without a moment’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
hesitation he made his way to the river bank
and found that a large raft had been moored
there. It was evidently on this that the spies
had made their way down the stream from some
point above. The raft was formed roughly of
tree trunks, but appeared to be of stout construction.
Some long oars for navigating it lay on
the logs; but Jack, in his hasty search, could not
see anything on board that might be of interest
to Captain Atkinson.</p>

<p>He had just completed his examination and
was preparing to go back on shore when something
happened that changed his plans. As if
by magic the figures of the men who had left the
raft reappeared at the water’s edge.</p>

<p>At the same instant that Jack spied them the
men became aware of the intruder on their raft.
They did not dare to fire the weapons they carried,
owing to the nearness of the Rangers; otherwise
they would undoubtedly have done so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Instead, they made a simultaneous leap at Jack,
the leader aiming a savage blow at him.</p>

<p>The boy dodged the man’s swing, springing
backward on the raft. The contrivance had not
been securely fastened to the bank. In fact, it
had merely been tied carelessly up at the water’s
edge. Jack’s sudden spring gave the raft a violent
jolt. The current caught it and whirled it
round as the strain came upon one side of it.</p>

<p>Before either Jack or the Mexicans exactly
realized what had occurred, the raft was swept
out into midstream, the current hurrying it along
swiftly.</p>

<p>But Jack was not alone on the swaying, pitching
craft. The Mexican who had aimed the blow
at him had had one foot on the raft when Jack’s
backward spring caused it to drift from the bank.
By a desperate effort he had managed to maintain
a foothold, and now he was crouching back
on his haunches like a wild&ndash;cat about to spring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
while in his hands gleamed a wicked looking
knife.</p>

<p>Jack had just time to see this when the fellow,
hissing out a torrent of Spanish oaths, sprang at
him. Jack dodged the knife blow, and before the
Mexican could recover his equilibrium the boy’s
fist had collided with the lower part of the Mexican’s
jaw.</p>

<p>The blow was a heavy one, and had landed
fair and square. With a grunt of pain and rage
the fellow reeled backward, almost pitching off
the raft. But in a jiffy he recovered from his
shock and rushed at Jack, snarling like a wild
beast.</p>

<p>The boy realized that he was in for a fight for
life, and in that moment he bitterly regretted the
curiosity that had caused him to board the raft,
although he had done it with the idea of performing
a service for the Rangers. Now, however,
he found himself facing a desperate situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Unarmed, and alone, he was on a drifting raft
with an armed and singularly ferocious foe.</p>

<p>“Yankee pig!” snarled out the Mexican, as he
flung himself at the boy.</p>

<p>Jack’s blood boiled at the insult. It acted as
a brace to his sinking heart. As the man lunged
at him the boy’s hand struck up the arm that held
the knife and the weapon went spinning into the
night. But the Mexican, a large man of uncommon
strength and activity, did not cease his attack.
He rushed at Jack as if to annihilate him.</p>

<p>This was just what Jack wanted. The angrier
the Mexican was the worse he would fight, as
Jack knew. He met the onrush with coolness,
and succeeded in planting two good blows on the
man’s body. But muscular as Jack was the blows
appeared to have little effect on the Mexican.
He tore in more savagely than ever.</p>

<p>Without his knife the Mexican was not much
of a fighter. He knew nothing of the art of boxing,
and Jack’s “gym” training stood him in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
stead. At last, in one of the Mexican’s frantic
rushes, Jack’s fist met the point of his chin with
deadly effect. With a wild swinging of his arms
the fellow reeled backward.</p>

<p>He would have fallen from the raft into the
current had not Jack leaped forward and saved
him. But the Mexican was a formidable foe no
longer. Jack’s blow had effectually stunned him
for a time, and as the boy saved him from pitching
overboard he sank in a heap on the floor of
the raft.</p>

<p>In the first opportunity he had had for observation
of his situation since the raft had got
loose, Jack looked about him. Then, for the first
time, he realized that the rough craft was proceeding
at an extremely swift rate. It was spinning
round dizzily, too, as though caught in some
sort of whirlpool.</p>

<p>Jack was still wondering how far they had
come and what was to be the outcome of this odd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
adventure, when something happened that effectually
put all other thoughts out of his head.</p>

<p>The air became filled with a roaring sound,
and spray began to dash upon the floor of the
raft. With a sharp thrill of alarm Jack recognized
that the roaring sound was the voice of a
waterfall, and that the raft was being swept toward
it at lightning speed. He seized up one of
the oars and attempted to head the raft for the
shore. But the oar might have been a straw for
all the effect it had against that rapid current.</p>

<p>All at once it snapped, almost hurling Jack
overboard. The next instant raft, boy and unconscious
man were swept into a vortex of
waters. Jack felt himself falling through space.
Simultaneously there came a crashing blow on his
head. A million constellations seemed to swim
before his eyes, and then, with a blinding flash
of fire, his senses left him.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE POOL OF DEATH.</p>

<p>The blow that had been dealt the boy came
from one of the timbers of the raft, which had
been torn to pieces as it was swept over the falls.
How long Jack remained insensible he did not
know; but when he recovered his senses he found
himself struggling in a seething pool of water
at the foot of the falls. Luckily he was able to
catch hold of one of the logs of the raft as it was
swept by him, and clinging to this he began to
strike out with his legs, hoping to make his way
to the edge of the pool.</p>

<p>Many times during that desperate struggle for
existence Jack felt certain that death would intervene
before he could accomplish his purpose.
Once another log, that was being swept round
like a straw in that boiling vortex of foaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
waters, was dashed against the one to which he
clung. The shock almost forced the lad to relinquish
his hold. But he hung on like grim death.</p>

<p>Blinded by foam and half choked, the boy,
with bull&ndash;dog grit, stuck to his purpose, and at
last was rewarded by feeling ground under his
feet. A moment later, bruised, breathless and
drenched to the skin, he flung himself panting on
the sandy shore of the pool, too exhausted to
move further.</p>

<p>He lay there, actually feeling more dead than
alive, for a long time before he felt capable of
moving. But at last he found strength to drag
himself further up the bank. Fumbling in his
pocket, he found that his water&ndash;tight match box
was in its proper place, and in the darkness he
set about making preparations to build a fire.
Luckily, on the brink of the pool there was any
quantity of dry wood cast up by the maelstrom
of waters, and the boy soon had a roaring blaze
kindled. Stripping to his underclothing he hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his other garments on sticks in front of the blaze
while he basked in its cheery rays.</p>

<p>By the glow he could see a part of the pool,
and as he gazed at its troublous surface and
foaming fury he marveled that he had been able
to escape with his life. The firelight also showed
him that he was in a sort of rock&ndash;walled bowl,
with steeply sloping sides scantily clad in places
with stunted bushes. He was still sitting by this
fire, trying to think of some way out of his dilemma,
when exhausted nature asserted herself
and he sank into a deep slumber beside the warm
blaze.</p>

<p>When he awoke the sun was shining down on
his face. The daylight showed him that he had
blundered into an astonishing place indeed. As
he had guessed, by what he could see of the place
by firelight, he was at the bottom of a rocky bowl
into which the falls over which he had tumbled
roared and thundered unceasingly as they had
been doing for uncounted centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack estimated the height of the falls as being
fully sixty feet. The boiling pool appeared to be
about an acre or so in extent, and was furiously
agitated by the constant pouring of the mighty
falls. And now Jack became aware of a curious
thing.</p>

<p>All about the edges of the pool, where the circular
motion of the water had evidently cast
them up, were myriads of bones. They appeared
to be the remains of cattle and various kinds of
game; but some of them caused Jack to shudder
as he had a distinct notion that they were of human
origin.</p>

<p>All at once, while he was still exploring the
strange place into which he had fallen, he came
across a bleached skull lying amid a pile of bones
and débris. The ghastly relic gave him a rude
shock as he gazed at it.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” the boy exclaimed, with a shudder,
“this place might well be called a Pool of
Death. How fortunate I am to be alive; although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
how I am going to get out of this scrape
I don’t know. One thing is certain, I cannot remount
by the falls. I must see what lies in the
other direction.”</p>

<p>Up to that moment, so agitated had the castaway
boy been that he had almost entirely forgotten
the Mexican with whom he had had the
battle on the raft. The thought of the man now
suddenly recurred to him. Jack sighed as he
realized that the Mexican could hardly have
been so fortunate as he had been. In all probability
he had forfeited his life to the Pool of
Death.</p>

<p>With such melancholy thoughts in his mind
Jack set about exploring the rocky basin for
some means of exit. Although he was determined
not to give way to despair, the boy could
not but own that his situation was well&ndash;nigh desperate.
He was many miles from his friends,
and probably in an uninhabited part of the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
He had no food; nor even if there had been
any game had he the means of shooting it.</p>

<p>His hunger was now beginning to make itself
painfully manifest. On some bushes that clung
to the walls of the Pool of Death were some
bright&ndash;colored berries, but Jack dreaded to try
them. For all he knew they might be deadly
poison.</p>

<p>Searching for an exit, Jack was not long in
finding one. The pool was drained by a narrow
crevice in the rocky walls, forming a passage.
On the brink of the water was a strip of beach,
not much wider than a man’s hand. Beside this
pathway the water roared and screamed in its
narrow bounds, but Jack knew that if he was to
get out of this place at all he must dare the rocky
passage.</p>

<p>Stifling his fears as well as he could, the famished,
bedraggled lad struck pluckily out. Sometimes
the passage grew so narrow that he could
have bestridden the stream. At other points it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
widened out and, looking up, Jack could see the
blue sky far overhead. In reality the passage
was not more than half a mile in length but, so
carefully did Jack have to proceed, it appeared
to be four times that length at least.</p>

<p>The passage ended with almost startling
abruptness. Jack could hardly repress an exclamation
of amazement as he saw upon what a
strange scene it opened. Beyond its mouth lay a
broad valley, carpeted with vivid green grass
and dotted here and there, like a park, with
groups of trees. Viewed in the sparkling sunlight
it was indeed a scene of rare beauty and
Jack’s heart gave a throb of delight as he beheld
it.</p>

<p>“Surely,” he thought, “some rancher must live
hereabouts who will give me food and lend me a
horse to ride back to San Mercedes.”</p>

<p>For the first few minutes following his discovery
of the valley the boy did not doubt but
that he should find an easy and speedy means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
escaping from his difficulties. But it gradually
began to dawn upon him that the place upon
which he had so oddly blundered was not inhabited
at all. At least, he could see no sign of a
human habitation.</p>

<p>Then, too, somewhat to his dismay, he noticed
another feature of the valley which had at first
escaped his attention altogether.</p>

<p>The place was completely enclosed by steep,
lofty cliffs, and appeared as if, at some early
period of the world’s growth, it had been dropped
below the level of the surrounding country by
some mighty convulsion of nature.</p>

<p>For the rest the valley appeared to be about a
mile in length and half a mile wide at its broadest
part. Through the center of it the stream
that issued from the passage beyond the Pool
of Death meandered leisurely along.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Jack, to himself, gazing
somewhat disconsolately about him, “this is a
beautiful spot into which I have wandered; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
somehow it doesn’t appear to solve my difficulties.
In the first place, I don’t believe it is frequented
by human beings, and in the second, so
far as I can see, there is no way out of it. I
wonder where on earth I can be? Certainly not
on the Rio Grande itself. I begin to suspect that
that current hurled the raft off into some side
stream which terminated in the falls.”</p>

<p>It may be said here that Jack’s theory was
correct. The valley in which he found himself
had been caused by a convulsion of nature similar
to that which effected the wonderful Yosemite
Valley in California. It was, in fact, a
miniature reproduction of that famous scenic
marvel. As the boy likewise suspected, the raft
had indeed been hurried by the stream from the
main current of the Rio Grande and drawn into
a side fork of the river.</p>

<p>Although Jack did not know it at the time, he
was on Mexican soil and far removed from his
friends, as he paced the strange secret valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess my best plan is to follow that stream,”
mused Jack, after a period of thought; “if I’m
not mistaken there must be some way out of the
valley at the spot where it emerges. At any rate
I’ll try it.”</p>

<p>He had walked some distance from the bank
of the stream in his explorations, and he now
began to re&ndash;thread his footsteps. He directed
his course toward a big rock that towered up by
the bank of the stream, apparently dislodged
at some remote time from the summit of the
lofty cliffs that hedged the place all about.</p>

<p>When Jack was within a few feet of the rock
he was brought to a sudden halt by a startling
occurrence.</p>

<p>From behind the monster boulder a human figure
emerged, and the next instant Jack was being
hailed by the sudden apparition.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">A STRANGE VALLEY.</p>

<p>Had he beheld the emergence of a supposedly
dead man from his tomb, the boy could not have
been much more startled. As it was the two
cases would have had much in common, for the
figure that now advanced toward him was that
of a man he had given up for dead&mdash;namely, the
Mexican who had shared that wild voyage on
the raft.</p>

<p>For an instant Jack instinctively threw himself
into an attitude of defense. But the next moment
he saw that he had nothing to fear from
the newcomer. In fact, a more woebegone figure
than the Mexican presented it would be hard to
imagine. There was a big gash over one of his
eyes, his clothing was torn to ribbons and he
limped painfully as he advanced toward Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did you come here?” asked Jack in
Spanish.</p>

<p>“Ah, señor, surely by a miracle of the saints,”
was the reply, as the man raised his eyes to
heaven. “I recollect your blow and then nothing
more till I found myself cast up on the bank of
yonder stream. Call it what you will, I believe
that it was a true miracle of Providence that my
life was saved.”</p>

<p>“We must both thank a higher power for our
deliverance,” said Jack reverently. “I never
thought that I should see you alive again.”</p>

<p>“But who are you?” demanded the Mexican.
“How came you on our raft before it went
adrift?”</p>

<p>Jack thought for a moment before replying,
and then he decided that it could do no possible
harm, under the circumstances, to tell who he
was.</p>

<p>“I am the son of an Arizona rancher,” he said.
“My name is Jack Merrill. With two companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I was accompanying the Texas Rangers on
a scouting trip for the sake of the experience.
While on guard duty I saw your raft land and
thought it my duty to try to find out what you
were doing on the American side of the river.”</p>

<p>To Jack’s surprise the other showed no trace
of anger. Instead he appeared grief stricken.</p>

<p>“Alas, señor,” he said, “you may have been
the cause of the death of my two companions,
for if the Texas Rangers captured them they
will assuredly shoot them.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure they would do no such thing,” rejoined
Jack indignantly; “they are not inhuman
wretches. If your companions can show that
they were doing no harm on our side of the
Border they will be released with a warning not
to spy upon Americans again.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then, you knew that we were spying,
señor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I overheard your conversation at the
river’s edge. But it is important now that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
should get out of this valley as soon as possible.
Have you any idea where we are?”</p>

<p>The Mexican shrugged his shoulders dubiously.</p>

<p>“Alas, señor, I am not certain, but I am inclined
to think that we are in what is called the
Lost Valley.”</p>

<p>“Lost Valley!” echoed Jack, struck by the dismal
suggestion of the name. “Is there no way
out?”</p>

<p>His companion shook his head.</p>

<p>“The legend says that they who blunder into
the valley never escape,” he declared.</p>

<p>Jack could not repress a shudder as he thought
of the skull by the pool; but the next instant he
regained his nerve, for he knew that the stream
must emerge from the valley somewhere.</p>

<p>“But surely this river has to find a way out of
the valley?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Si, señor,” was the reply, “but the stream, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
they say, burrows its way through a tunnel by
which no human being could hope to pass.”</p>

<p>“Then you mean that we are prisoners here?”</p>

<p>“Unless somebody discovers us&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“Are there many people dwelling in this part
of the country?” inquired Jack, with a sinking
heart, for, despite his effort to keep up his cheerfulness,
his hope was fast ebbing.</p>

<p>“No, it is a wild section devoted to cattle raising,
and only a few wandering vaqueros ever
come this way. It is from them that the news of
the Lost Valley, which this may be, reached the
outer world.”</p>

<p>“But we must escape,” cried Jack wildly, “we
can’t remain here. We have no food, no means
of getting any, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have my revolver,” interrupted the Mexican,
“also plenty of cartridges. Perhaps we can
find some game.”</p>

<p>This at least was a spark of cheering news.
Both Jack and the Mexican were almost famished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and decided to set out at once to see if
they could bring down anything to serve as food.
A revolver is not much of a weapon to use in
hunting; but the Mexican declared that he was
highly proficient with it. Jack hadn’t much confidence
in his own ability as a revolver shot, so
it was agreed that his dark&ndash;skinned companion
should do the shooting.</p>

<p>They ranged the valley for some time without
seeing a sign of life, when suddenly, from a
clump of trees, there sprang three deer&mdash;two
does and a buck.</p>

<p>Bang! went the revolver, and the buck slackened
speed and staggered. A crimson stream
from his shoulder showed that he had been
badly wounded. But it took two more shots to
bring him down. He was then dispatched with
Jack’s knife. No time was lost in cutting off
some steaks from the dead buck, a fire was speedily
kindled and an appetizing aroma of broiling
venison came from it. The meat was cooked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
being held over the glowing wood coals on sticks
of hard wood. Jack could hardly wait till his
was cooked to eat it.</p>

<p>Fresh deer meat is not the delicacy that some
of my readers may suppose. It is coarse,
stringy and rather tasteless; but neither Jack
nor his companion were in a mood to be particular.
They devoured the meat ravenously, although
they had no salt, bread or any other
relish. But the meat strengthened Jack wonderfully,
and as soon as it had been eaten he proposed
that they should explore the valley thoroughly
in an attempt to find a way out.</p>

<p>The Mexican was nothing loath; but he was
dubious about there being any avenue of escape.
However, with the stoical fatalism of his race he
appeared to accept the situation philosophically.</p>

<p>Before setting out on their expedition the deer
meat was hung in one of the trees as a protection
in case any wild animals should get scent
of it. This done, the Border Boy and his oddly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
contrasted companion set off, trudging around
the valley in a determined effort to effect their
escape in some way.</p>

<p>Several cañons that opened off into the rocky
walls were examined, but they all proved to be
“blind” and impassable. In exploring one of
these Jack had a thrilling adventure.</p>

<p>His foot slipped on a rock and he plunged into
a deep hole among some boulders. He was about
to scramble out again, when from one of the
rock crevices a hideous flat head darted. At the
same time a curious dry, rattling sound was
heard on every side of him. The boy recognized
the noise with a sharp thrill of alarm.</p>

<p>The sound was the vibration of the horny tails
of dozens of diamond&ndash;backed “rattlers,” into a
den of which he had fallen. On every side flat
heads with evil&ndash;looking, leaden eyes were darting
in and out of the rocks. The boy was paralyzed
with fear. He dared not move a hand or foot
lest he precipitate an attack by the loathsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
creatures. As soon as he recovered his wits he
set up a shout for his Mexican friend, who had
told him that his name was Manuel Alvarez.</p>

<p>Alvarez was quickly on the spot. He took in
the situation at a glance, and cautioning Jack not
to move, he fired his revolver down into the den
of noisome reptiles. The bullet passed so close
to Jack’s head that he could feel it fan the air.
But, as the report of the pistol volleyed and
crashed among the rocks, every rattler vanished.</p>

<p>“Now come out quickly!” ordered Alvarez,
reaching down a hand to Jack, who took it and
scrambled out of the pit of snakes.</p>

<p>As he thanked the Mexican for his promptness
in acting, the boy could not help thinking in
what an extraordinary situation he was involved.</p>

<p>Lost in a hidden valley with, for companion,
a man who, not more than a few hours ago, had
been bent on killing him, now it was to that man
that he owed his life.</p>

<p>“This is surely one of the strangest adventures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in which I have ever taken part,” mused
the Border Boy, as the two castaways resumed
their dreary search for a passage to the outer
world.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">NATURE’S PRISONERS.</p>

<p>But despite the most painstaking investigation
of the valley, a task which occupied them till
almost sundown, the two oddly assorted prisoners
were unable to find anything that promised
a means of escape. They reached the spot where
they had left the deer and flung themselves wearily
down upon the ground, too disheartened and
tired even to voice their disappointment.</p>

<p>“Gracious! Men imprisoned in a jail could not
be more effectually shut in,” said Jack, at length;
“I feel almost like dashing myself against these
rock walls.”</p>

<p>His companion was compelled to admit that
their situation did indeed seem a hard one. For
some time they sat buried in thought. Jack’s
mind was back in the camp of the Rangers. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
wondered how his friends felt over his disappearance,
and what steps were being taken to
find him. How bitterly his heart ached to see his
boy chums again he did not say for fear of breaking
down.</p>

<p>“We <i>must</i> get out of this horrible place,” he
cried, at length, “to&ndash;morrow as soon as it is light
I mean to examine the cliffs and, if possible, to
scale them.”</p>

<p>“You could not find a place that would afford
a foothold,” objected his companion.</p>

<p>“I’ll try, at any rate. I’d rather almost be
dashed to death than drag out a lingering existence
in this valley,” burst out the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, let us have supper,” said Alvarez presently,
“there is nothing to be gained by railing
at our fate. If the saints do not will that we
shall escape, depend upon it we will not.”</p>

<p>So saying he rose to his feet, shrugging his
shoulders resignedly.</p>

<p>“What a contrast between the indifference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
such a race and the rugged determination of an
American,” thought Jack, as he set to work to
rekindle the embers of the fire that had cooked
their mid&ndash;day meal.</p>

<p>He was blowing them into flame when Alvarez
called to him from among the trees. He had
found a species of oak which was burdened with
acorns. These, the Mexican declared, could be
made into a kind of bread if crushed and mixed
with water. As this would be a welcome addition
to ungarnished deer meat, Jack was proportionately
pleased at the discovery. The Mexican
set to work and ground the acorns between two
flat stones, after which he heated one of the latter
till it was almost red&ndash;hot. This done, the
acorn paste was spread out on it, and before long
there was produced a rather “doughy” sort of
flap&ndash;jack or pan&ndash;cake. When one side was done
Alvarez turned it till it was nicely browned. By
this time Jack had some broiled venison ready,
and they sat down to their second meal in the
Lost Valley with good appetites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The acorn flap&ndash;jack proved to be not at all unpalatable.
It was rather sweet and had a peculiar
flavor; at any rate it afforded some variety
to the plain deer meat.</p>

<p>“Well, we shan’t starve here, at least,” commented
the Mexican, as they ate; “there seem
to be plenty of deer and small game and an unlimited
supply of acorns for bread.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose if it came down to that, we
could live here for a century, like two Robinson
Crusoes,” agreed Jack, rather bitterly, “but that’s
not my plan. I mean to escape.”</p>

<p>“The young are always hopeful,” rejoined Alvarez,
with one of his all&ndash;expressive shrugs; “I
suppose you think you can carry out your plan.”</p>

<p>“I mean to make a mighty hard try at it, anyhow,”
said Jack, setting his lips in a determined
line.</p>

<p>That evening as they sat by their camp fire,
Alvarez told Jack that he and his two companions
on the raft had been leaders of the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
wing of the revolutionary army. They had
chosen the raft as a medium to spy from, he explained,
because it was possible in that way to
ascertain what the border patrol was doing, without
so much risk of being discovered as would
have been the case had they used horses.</p>

<p>“I guess you wish you’d never seen the raft
by this time,” commented Jack, throwing some
fresh wood on the fire.</p>

<p>“I do, indeed,” agreed the other fervently.</p>

<p>Soon after this they composed themselves to
sleep, but it was long before Jack closed his eyes.</p>

<p>He was just dozing off when the sound of a
furtive footfall made him sit up, broad awake in
an instant. From the darkness two green points
were blazing at him.</p>

<p>“The eyes of some wild beast that has decided
to pay us a visit,” said Jack to himself.</p>

<p>He was just about to arouse Alvarez and get
the revolver when the creature that was prowling
about the camp gave a sudden leap. Jack saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
lithe body launched at him just in time to roll to
one side.</p>

<p>The creature, balked in its spring, came down
in the midst of the hot ashes of the smoldering
fire. Instantly a piercing howl of anguish split
the night. The Mexican leaped up and appeared
to be fully awake the instant he opened his eyes.
At any rate the great, tawny body was still
writhing about in the embers when two shots
crackled from his revolver. The big animal gave
a spring and another howl of pain and then fell
over in a heap, rolling to one side of the fire.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;whatever was it?” cried Jack, rather
timorously, for the suddenness of the attack had
rather unnerved him.</p>

<p>“A mountain lion, and a monster, too,” came
the reply. “Come up and take a look at him.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure he is dead?”</p>

<p>“Positive. Wait a minute and I’ll make sure,
however.”</p>

<p>So saying the Mexican stooped and picked a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
glowing coal out of the fire. He threw it so that
it fell on the motionless beast’s hide. But the
animal did not stir. Unquestionably it was quite
dead. Jack approached it, having poked up the
fire the better to see the brute. He marveled at
its size. It was indeed a giant of its kind and
must have weighed six hundred pounds or more,
and was lithe and sinewy as a cat.</p>

<p>“What splendid condition it is in! I’d like to
skin it and take the hide out of this valley as a
souvenir.”</p>

<p>“So you are still certain that we can get out?”</p>

<p>“I am not <i>certain</i>, but I don’t want to give
over trying till we have tested every avenue of
hope.”</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> But you Americans are wonderful
people! A Mexican boy would be sitting around
crying if he were in the same fix. In the morning
we will take the pelt off this brute, and if we
ever do get out, the skin will always serve as a
memento of a dreadful time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>The mountain lion scare being over, they composed
themselves to sleep again. Jack recollected
having read or heard that when a mountain lion
is killed, its mate will find it out and avenge it.
But even though the thought gave him cause for
disquietude he was not able to stay awake; and
although distant howlings told him that another
puma was in the vicinity, nature asserted herself
and sealed his eyes in slumber.</p>

<p>The sun had hardly peeped above the rim of
the bowl&ndash;like valley when Jack and Alvarez were
astir. Breakfast was cooked and eaten hurriedly,
and then the great lion was skinned. This
done, Jack started out to put his plans in execution.</p>

<p>The Mexican did not accompany him. He
deemed Jack’s mission a useless one. In fact, it
did seem very like an attempt at suicide to try
to scale the valley’s lofty, almost perpendicular
walls.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">A CLIMB FOR LIFE.</p>

<p>Jack strolled along at the foot of the cliffs,
anxiously scanning every inch of them in the
hope of spying some place that afforded an opportunity
to climb upward. The cliffs varied in
height from two hundred to three, and even four
hundred feet. Great beetling crags of gray
stone, too steep to afford roothold to more than
a few scanty shrubs, filled him with oppression
and gloom.</p>

<p>The boy felt this disheartening influence as he
made his way along the edges of the valley.
From time to time he sighted game&mdash;deer, rabbits
and a good many quail; but as he had not
brought their solitary firearm along he did not
pay much attention to the animals.</p>

<p>At last he halted at the foot of a cliff that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
less precipitous than the others. It had, in fact,
a slight slope to it, and was more closely grown
with bushes and small trees which might be
grasped by any one attempting to climb it.</p>

<p>Jack had his knife with him, a heavy&ndash;bladed,
business&ndash;like bit of cutlery of finely tempered
steel, but strong and thick withal. He drew it
out, opened the blade and began hacking at the
cliff’s face. It was of a soft sort of stone, and he
could easily cut depressions in it.</p>

<p>“Good,” murmured the boy, “I actually believe
that I may be able to scale this cliff, although it
may take a long time.”</p>

<p>He gauged its height carefully and estimated
that from the floor of the valley to the summit of
the precipice it must be fully three hundred feet.</p>

<p>“If the situation was not so desperate I would
never dream of attempting to climb that awful
height,” mused the boy, “but necessity often
drives where courage would falter.”</p>

<p>So thinking, he cast off his coat, laid it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
ground and his hat beside it. Then he clambered
over the pile of stones that lay at the foot of the
cliff and began his climb. For the first forty
feet or so his task was not so difficult. But it
was hot, and the perspiration began to run off
the laboring lad in streams.</p>

<p>He paused to rest. Jack was now, as has been
said, about two score feet from the floor of the
valley. Up to this point the cliff had sloped at
quite an angle; but now it reared itself upward
in a seemingly impassable escarpment, like the
wall of a giant’s castle.</p>

<p>“Now for the real tug&ndash;of&ndash;war,” thought Jack,
when he had rested.</p>

<p>Tightening his belt, he braced himself for
what he knew would be a desperately dangerous
climb. First he dug out holes to fit his hands
and then began working his way up. From time
to time he was able to grasp bushes and stunted
trees, and these helped him greatly in his task.
When he reached even the narrowest ledge he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
laid down to rest, extending himself at full
length and panting like a spent hound.</p>

<p>Owing to the soft nature of the rock, however,
he progressed rather better than he had anticipated.
But it was slow work. From time to
time the face of the cliff was so precipitous that
he was compelled to make a detour to find an
easier place to cut his steps.</p>

<p>Once he looked down; but he did not repeat the
experiment. The sight of the dizzy height, to
which he clung like some crawling insect, almost
unnerved him. For several minutes, with a palpitating
heart and a sickened feeling at the pit
of his stomach, he hugged the rock, not daring
to look either up or down.</p>

<p>But at last his courage came back and he began
his painful progress upward once more.
Foot by foot he climbed, and at last, when resting
on a ledge, he dared to look about him to see
what progress he had made. To his delight he
saw that he had come more than halfway up the
precipice, although above him its rugged face
still towered frowningly as if daring him to surmount
it.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I would never have believed that I could
have climbed to such a height with so little inconvenience,”
mused the boy. “Of course, the
climb is a good deal rougher than it looks from
below; but still it’s an experience I wouldn’t go
through again for hundreds of dollars.”</p>

<p>Having rested on the ledge and munched some
deer meat and acorn flap&ndash;jack which he had
brought with him, Jack recommenced his climb.
It spoke marvels for his cool head, great strength
and wonderful endurance that the boy had progressed
as far as he had. Few but an American
youth of the most steel&ndash;like fiber and sterling grit
would have dared to undertake such a task. And
yet, before Jack there still lay the hardest part
of his endeavor.</p>

<p>So steep was the cliff face now that the lad did
not dare to pause in his climb. He steadily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
progressed although his hands were cut and
bleeding by this time, and his feet ached as
cruelly as did other parts of his anatomy. But
just when it seemed to the lad that his body
could not stand another fraction of an ounce of
strain, he happened on a place where a watercourse
from above had cut a sort of shallow cleft
in the precipice. In this grew shrubs and several
trees, and Jack struggled to gain this oasis in
the dangerous desert of his climb for life.</p>

<p>Gaining it, he flung himself at full length
on a bed of sweet smelling yellow flowers
under the shade of a broad&ndash;leaved bay tree. In
the stillness of that lonely and awful height,
halfway between earth and sky, his breathing
sounded as loud as the exhaust of a steam engine.
But by&ndash;and&ndash;by he recovered his breath,
and began to wish with all his soul for some
water.</p>

<p>That fearful climb had racked both nerve and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
muscle; but even more than his fatigue did Jack
feel the cruel pangs of a burning thirst. Some
grass grew in that lonely little grove on the cliff
face, and he chewed some of this for the sake of
the moisture that exuded from it. But this was
far from satisfying. In fact, it only aggravated
his thirst by mocking it.</p>

<p>He rose on one elbow and looked about him.
At a short distance up the steep, dry watercourse
he saw a patch of vivid green. To his mind that
could betoken nothing but the presence of water
near the surface. At any rate he felt that it was
worth investigating.</p>

<p>Reaching the patch of verdure, the boy fell
on his hands and knees, and with a sharp&ndash;edged
stone began scraping away at the ground. To
his unspeakable delight he had not dug down
more than a few inches before the ground began
to grow moist.</p>

<p>Greatly encouraged, he dug away with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
improvised tool with renewed vigor. He excavated
quite a hole, and then lay down in the
shade waiting for it to fill up. Before long a
few inches of warm, muddy&ndash;colored liquid could
be discerned at the bottom of the hole. It did
not look inviting, this coffee&ndash;colored, tepid mixture,
but Jack was not in the mood to be fastidious.</p>

<p>Casting himself down on his stomach, he
plunged his face into the water, sucking it greedily
in. Then he bathed his hands and face. He
was still engaged in this last occupation when
his attention was distracted by a low growl from
below him.</p>

<p>The boy looked up quickly, and then almost
toppled over backward with astonishment.</p>

<p>Facing him, and lashing its stubby tail angrily,
was a large bob&ndash;cat. The creature had its wicked&ndash;looking
teeth bared, and the boy could see its
sharp claws. How it came to be in that place he
could not imagine. But its emaciated condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
seemed to indicate that it must have in some way
fallen from the cliff above.</p>

<p>Evidently it was half mad from deprivation of
food and water, for under ordinary conditions a
bob&ndash;cat&mdash;although a really dangerous foe if cornered&mdash;will
not attack a human being without
provocation.</p>

<p>The wild beast’s object was, evidently, to get
at the water hole which Jack had so painstakingly
scooped out. The boy would have been
willing enough to allow it to accomplish its purpose.
But evidently the half famished creature
regarded him as an enemy to be dispatched before
it proceeded to slake its thirst.</p>

<p>It crouched down till its fawn&ndash;colored belly
touched the ground and then, uttering a snarling
sort of cry, it launched its body through the
air at the boy.</p>

<p>So strong was its leap that tempered steel
springs could not have hurled its body forward
with more velocity. Jack uttered an involuntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
cry of alarm. Above him was the steep cliff,
while to move even a short distance in either
direction from the dry watercourse would mean
a death plunge to the valley below.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">A BATTLE IN MID&ndash;AIR.</p>

<p>But Jack Merrill’s mind never worked quicker
or to better effect than in an emergency. He
perceived the instant that the creature crouched
that its intention was to spring on him. Swift
as a flash he reached down and seized a stone.</p>

<p>As the bob&ndash;cat hurled itself into the air Jack’s
arm shot out. The stone sped from his hand
and caught the creature fairly between the eyes.
Had a bullet struck it the animal could not have
been checked more effectually. It dropped to the
ground, rolled up in a furry ball, scratching and
spitting furiously, and then, with a yowl of rage
and pain, it lost its footing on the edge of the
watercourse.</p>

<p>The last Jack saw of it the creature plunged
over the brink of the precipice up which the Border<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Boy had so laboriously toiled. As he heard
the body go rolling and bumping down toward
the valley, Jack shuddered. Had things turned
out differently he might have been in its place,
for the boy well knew that if once the maddened
animal had fastened its claws in him he would
not have stood a chance without a weapon.</p>

<p>Jack sat down to rest once more, this time
keeping a cautious lookout for any other wild
creatures; but none appeared, and it was evident
that his theory that the animal had accidentally
dropped from above was a correct one.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack to himself, after an interval,
“if I’m to get to the top of that cliff I’ve got to
start in right now. Ugh! It doesn’t look as if
I could possibly make it; but then it’s equally
certain that I can’t climb down again. The
thought makes me sick; so I’ve <i>got</i> to tackle it.
There’s no other way out of it.”</p>

<p>Fortifying himself by a cooling drink, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he added another wash, the boy prepared to take
up his task again.</p>

<p>Above the dry watercourse the cliff shot up
more precipitously than the part he had already
traversed below it; but Jack steeled himself to
the thought of the dizzy climb. Knife in hand he
worked his way up, clinging to the face of the
cliff desperately at times, and again resting
where some vagrant bush offered him a hand or
foothold.</p>

<p>In the meantime, below in the valley, Alvarez,
returning from a hunt for more food, began to
worry about the boy. Not a bad man at heart,
Alvarez was a true son of the Mexican revolution.
He decided that all Americans, or Gringoes,
as he contemptuously called them, were the
born foes of the Mexicans. It had been with
this conviction that he and his companions had
set out to spy on the Rangers who, they thought,
menaced them, instead of merely patrolling the
Border to prevent lawless acts on American soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Since his brief acquaintance with Jack, however,
Alvarez had found cause to revise his opinion.
Himself a courageous man, he admired
courage and grit in others, and of these qualities
we know Jack possessed full and abundant
measure.</p>

<p>Returning, then, from his hunt with some
quail and rabbits, Alvarez began to be seriously
alarmed about Jack. Not for one moment did the
Mexican deem it possible that the lad could have
actually found a way to scale those awful cliffs.
He had confidently expected that on his return to
camp he would find Jack awaiting him. When,
therefore, he could see no trace of the boy his
alarm was genuine and deep.</p>

<p>He carefully deposited his game out of harm’s
way in the trees, and then set out to see if he
could find any trace of the boy to whom he had
become attached in their short acquaintance.</p>

<p>As he advanced below the cliffs he carefully
scanned the foot of the precipitous heights for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
what he dreaded to find; for Alvarez had begun
to fear that Jack had made a daring attempt to
escape and summon help and had met death in a
fearful fall from the rocky crags.</p>

<p>“The boy would have been mad to attempt
such a climb,” he muttered, as he moved along,
“why, not even a mountain goat could find a
foothold up yonder. It is impossible that he
should have tried such a thing. It would have
been sheer madness. And yet&mdash;and yet when it
comes to such things the Gringoes are assuredly
mad. They will dare anything it seems.”</p>

<p>Musing thus the Mexican traversed the greater
part of the valley, pondering deeply over the
possible fate of his young friend.</p>

<p>“It is a thing without explanation that he
could have climbed even a few feet up those
cliffs,” ran the burden of his thoughts; “yet if
he has not, why do I not see a trace of him here
below?”</p>

<p>“<i>Caramba!</i> Can it be that he has slipped on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
lofty crag and is suspended high above the valley,
injured, perhaps dying, and beyond reach of
human aid?”</p>

<p>On and on trudged the Mexican, growing
more and more alarmed every instant.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he cast his eye up toward the
summit of a lofty precipice, his attention was
caught by an object moving slowly up its surface,
like a fly on a high wall.</p>

<p>The Mexican gazed steadily at it. He believed
that it was an eagle or condor hovering about its
nest in the dizzy heights, but still something odd
about the moving object arrested and gripped
his attention irresistibly.</p>

<p>“No, it is not an eagle,” he muttered, “but,
then, what is it? No quadruped could climb that
cliff. What, then, can it be?”</p>

<p>The sun was sinking low over the western
wall of the cañon and the valley itself was beginning
to be shrouded in purple shadow. But at
that great height the light was still bright. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the moving object emerged from a patch
of shade cast by an overhanging rock.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the Mexican almost sprang
into the air under the shock of his amazement.
He crossed himself and then his lips moved.</p>

<p>“By the Saints! It’s Jack Merrill!” he cried,
in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood like a thing of wood or
stone, every muscle rigid in terrible suspense.
And all the time that tiny speck on the cliff face
was moving slowly and painfully upward.</p>

<p>Clasping his hands the Mexican stood riveted
to the spot. Then his dry lips began to move.</p>

<p>“The saints aid him! The brave boy is working
his way to the top of the cliff. He has neared
its summit. But can he win it? And, see, there
are the steps he has cut in the lower cliff face.
It must be that he is working his way upward
still by those means. Santa Maria! What courage!</p>

<p>“I dare not call out to him. At that fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
height one backward look might cause him to
lose his hold and plunge downward like a stone.
Oh, if I could only help, only do something to
aid him! But, no, I must stand here helpless,
unable to move hand or foot.</p>

<p>“Never again will I say anything against a
Gringo. No boy south of the Border would dare
such a feat. See now! <i>Caramba!</i> For an instant
he slipped. I dare not look.”</p>

<p>The Mexican buried his face in his hands and
crouched on the ground. Emotional as are all
of his race, the sight of that battle between life
and death, hundreds of feet above him, had almost
unstrung him.</p>

<p>At last he dared to uncover his eyes again and
once more fixed them on the toiling atom on the
sunlit cliff face.</p>

<p>But now he burst out into tones of joy.</p>

<p>“Sanctissima Maria! See, he is almost at the
summit. Oh, brave Gringo! Climb on. May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
your head be steady and your hands and feet
nimble.”</p>

<p>The sweat was pouring down the Mexican’s
face, his knees smote together and his hands
shook as he stood like one paralyzed, stock still,
watching the outcome of Jack Merrill’s fearful
climb. His breath came fast and the veins on
his forehead stood out like whip cords. As he
watched thus his lips moved in constant, silent
prayers for the safety of the young Border Boy.</p>

<p>At last he saw the infinitesimal speck that was
Jack Merrill reach the summit of that frowning
height. He saw the boy thrust his knife into his
belt, and watched him place one hand on the ridge
of the precipice and draw himself up.</p>

<p>The next instant the cliff face was bare of life.
The fight with death had been won. But Alvarez
as he saw Jack attain safety on the summit of
the precipice sank back with a groan. The
strain under which he had labored had caused
the Mexican to swoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>As he lay there perfectly still three figures appeared
at the upper end of the valley in the direction
of the Pool of Death. They began advancing
down the valley just as Alvarez opened his
eyes and staggered dizzily to his feet.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">RANGERS ON THE TRAIL.</p>

<p>It was about an hour after he had secured the
firearm which he intended for Jack’s use that
Baldy rode back into the Rangers’ camp in, what
was for him, a state of great perturbation. The
Chinaman was still up scouring dishes, and to
him Baldy rode, spurring his pony almost into
the remains of the camp fire in his anxiety.</p>

<p>All about lay the recumbent forms of the
Rangers, sleeping under the stars on the expanse
of plain. Snores and deep breathing showed
that every one of them was deeply wrapped in
the healthy slumber of the plainsman.</p>

<p>“Wallee maller, Massel Baldy?” cried the
Mongolian, as Baldy spurred his pony up to him.</p>

<p>“Nuffin, you yellow&ndash;mugged Chinee,” shot out
Baldy, breathing tensely, despite his effort to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
appear careless; “have you seen anything of that
Tenderfoot that went on watch with me a while
ago?”</p>

<p>“No, me no see him, Massel Baldy. Whafo’
you so heap much ’cited?”</p>

<p>The keen&ndash;eyed Oriental had pierced Baldy’s
mask of carelessness, and saw readily enough
that the old plainsman was badly worried.</p>

<p>“Me excited, you pig&ndash;tailed gopher!” roared
out Baldy angrily. “I was never so easy&ndash;minded
in my life. Where’s the cap sleeping?”</p>

<p>“Over yonder, Massel Baldy. Him litee by
chuck wagon.”</p>

<p>Baldy did not wait to make a reply. He
steered his plunging pony skillfully among the
sleeping Rangers till he reached a bundled&ndash;up
heap of blankets which he knew must contain
Captain Atkinson. Baldy threw himself from
his horse in an instant, at the same time slipping
the reins over his pony’s head, according to the
plainsman’s custom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Reaching down, he shook the captain vigorously.</p>

<p>“Hello! hello, there, what’s up?” came a muffled
rejoinder from amidst the blankets.</p>

<p>But the next instant Captain Atkinson, broad
awake, was sitting up.</p>

<p>“Oh, you, Baldy? Well, what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Dunno jes’ erzackly, boss,” stammered out
Baldy, “but it’s about that Tenderfoot kid that
you gave me ter mind.”</p>

<p>Baldy was plainly embarrassed. He shoved
back his sombrero and scratched his head vigorously.
At the same time he jingled his spurs
as he shifted his feet nervously.</p>

<p>Captain Atkinson’s tone was sharp when he
next spoke.</p>

<p>“You mean Jack Merrill? I’d have you understand,
Baldy, that he is no Tenderfoot. He’s
only a boy, but he’s been through as much as
most men of twice his years. But what about
him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>If the question was sharp and to the point, as
was Captain Atkinson’s wont, so was Baldy’s
answer. Rangers are not men who are in the
habit of wasting words.</p>

<p>“He’s went.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I mean what I say, boss. The kid’s vamoosed,
gone, skidooed.”</p>

<p>“No nonsense, Baldy. Explain yourself.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t much to explain, boss.”</p>

<p>“If Jack Merrill has gone, I should say that
there was a good deal to explain on your part.”</p>

<p>Baldy shifted uneasily.</p>

<p>“It warn’t no fault of mine, boss,” he protested.</p>

<p>“I’ll be the judge of that. What’s your story?”</p>

<p>“Just this. The kid went on watch with me.
As you told me, I kept him close alongside. He
didn’t hev no shootin’ iron, so I rode back to
camp to git one. When I got back to the Rio
he was gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Gone?”</p>

<p>“That’s what.”</p>

<p>“Have you looked for him?”</p>

<p>“Beat the brush frum San Antone to breakfus’,
but ther ain’t no sign uv hair nor hide uv
him.”</p>

<p>“You saw the other men?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“Did they know nothing?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. But the kid couldn’t hev passed
in either direction without goin’ up in an air
ship.”</p>

<p>“None of your jokes. This is serious. Answer
my questions. You left him where?”</p>

<p>“Not far from the foot of the trail to the waterin’
place.”</p>

<p>“You told him to stay there?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. You see I lef’ him ter git him a
shootin’ iron. I didn’t think it was right that
he shouldn’t be heeled. The greasers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All right, never mind that part of it. Well,
you got the gun?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and when I took it back fer him ther
kid had gone.”</p>

<p>“How long did all this take?”</p>

<p>“Waal, I’ve bin huntin’ fer ther dern little
pinto ever since. But I should say that I rode
to camp and back in about half an hour. You
see, I hurried.”</p>

<p>“Humph! You found no sign of trouble when
you got back?”</p>

<p>“Nary a bit. All wuz quiet as a Chink’s funeral
in Tombstone.”</p>

<p>“Had the others heard nothing while you were
away?”</p>

<p>“Not a sound so fur as they told me.”</p>

<p>“It’s not possible to ford the river at that
point?”</p>

<p>“Boss, a cayuse couldn’t swim it, the current’s
that swift.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, too, I thought for a moment that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the boy might have foolishly tried to cross into
Mexican territory.”</p>

<p>“Ef he did, it’s flowers fer his’n ef we ever
find him,” declared Baldy piously.</p>

<p>“Let us hope it is not as bad as that. But it
is most mysterious.”</p>

<p>“Very consterious,” agreed Baldy. “You see,
there were men to the east and west of where
the kid was, and they didn’t hear nor see nothing.”</p>

<p>“And yet the boy has vanished.”</p>

<p>“Waal, he ain’t ter be found,” admitted Baldy,
ignoring the long word.</p>

<p>Captain Atkinson sat up in his blankets lost
in thought. At length Baldy ventured to break
in on the silence.</p>

<p>“What yer goin’ ter do, boss? Ther young
maverick may be needin’ help right now and
needin’ it bad, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s correct, Baldy. We must take some
action at once. But the case is so puzzling that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
I hardly know what to do about it. Jack Merrill
didn’t impress me as the kind of boy that would
run needlessly into danger.”</p>

<p>“No; ther young pinto had some hoss sense,”
admitted Baldy, flicking his chaps with his quirt.</p>

<p>“That being the case, how are we to account
for his disappearance? If he had been attacked
by greasers there would have been some noise,
some disturbance.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he jes’ fell in ther Rio and was
drown&ndash;ded,” suggested Baldy.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that. Jack Merrill is an athletic
lad, and among other things, I am told, a first&ndash;class
swimmer. No, we have to figure on some
other line.”</p>

<p>“Waal, I’m free to admit that I’m up a tree,
boss,” grunted Baldy.</p>

<p>By this time Captain Atkinson was out of his
blankets and hastily drawing on his chaps and
pulling his blue cowboy shirt over his head.
When his boots had been drawn on and spurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
adjusted he ordered Baldy to saddle his pony
and bring it over. As soon as this was done the
Captain of the Rangers and Baldy rode out of
the camp as silently as possible and made their
way to the river. But all Captain Atkinson’s
questioning failed to elicit any more facts than
he had been able to glean from Baldy. There
was nothing left to do but to wait for daybreak
to make an examination for tracks that might
throw some light on the mystery.</p>

<p>In the meantime Ralph and Walt were informed
of Jack’s mysterious disappearance. To
Captain Atkinson’s astonishment, they did not
appear nearly so much alarmed as he had feared.
Instead, they accepted the news with almost
stoical faces.</p>

<p>“You think that Jack is safe, then?” asked the
captain of the Rangers. “At any rate, you don’t
seem much worried about him.”</p>

<p>“It’s not our way to worry till we know we
have good cause to, Captain,” rejoined Ralph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
“If Jack has vanished, I’m willing to swear that
he is off on some sort of duty connected with
the Rangers. Possibly he had not time to report
back before leaving. Depend upon it, Jack will
come out all right.”</p>

<p>“That’s my idea, too,” declared Walt stoutly.</p>

<p>“Well, I admire the confidence you boys have
in your leader,” declared Captain Atkinson
warmly, “but just the same as soon as it’s daylight
I mean to start a thorough investigation,
and if harm has come to him it will go hard
with those that caused it.”</p>

<p class="pch">A BAFFLING PURSUIT.</p>

<p>But a close scrutiny of the river banks by daylight
failed to reveal anything more definite than
a maze of trampled footmarks and broken brush
at the spot where Jack had encountered his combat
with the three Mexican spies. Captain Atkinson,
one of the most expert of men in the
plainsman’s art of reading signs from seemingly
insignificant features, confessed that he was
baffled.</p>

<p>“It is plain enough that Jack was involved in
some sort of a fight,” he said, “but beyond that
I cannot say. The most puzzling thing about
his disappearance, in fact, lies in the absence of
pony tracks. I can’t imagine how whoever it
was attacked him reached this vicinity without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
being heard by the sentries east and west of the
trail.”</p>

<p>“Can it not be possible that in some manner
he fell into the river and was swept away by the
swift current?” inquired Ralph.</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>“Of course, it is possible, but it hardly lies
within the range of probabilities,” he declared.</p>

<p>They were still discussing the extraordinary
situation when Baldy uttered an exclamation.
He had been examining the river bank and now
he held up a bit of rope that he had discovered
on the verge of the stream.</p>

<p>“Look here, cap,” he cried, “I’m a long&ndash;horned
maverick if this ain’t queer.”</p>

<p>“A bit of rope, eh, Baldy?” rejoined the captain.
“Well, that would seem to indicate that
something had been tied there. Clearly it was
not a horse or we should see the tracks. It
must then have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A boat!” burst in Walt, unable to control
himself.</p>

<p>“How could a boat ever get along in this shallow,
swirling stream?” cried Ralph.</p>

<p>“No; but some contrivance of logs that would
float, such as a raft, might have navigated the
river,” suggested Captain Atkinson, little guessing
how close he was to the truth.</p>

<p>The captain now had the rope in his hands and
was examining the frayed end.</p>

<p>“This rope has been recently severed,” he
decided.</p>

<p>“Cut?” questioned Ralph.</p>

<p>“No, broken,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Then ther kid must have gone down the
river,” said Baldy.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” rejoined the captain.</p>

<p>“In that case we must follow the stream in
search of him,” cried Walt.</p>

<p>“Yes. We will start as soon as possible, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Baldy, see that everything is made ready for us
at once.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t I going along, cap?” pleaded Baldy.</p>

<p>“No; I shall leave you in command of the
camp till I return. In the meantime the boys
and I will ride back with you to camp and prepare
for our expedition.”</p>

<p>The boys’ faces were flushed with excitement
as the return ride was begun. Eagerly they discussed
between themselves the probabilities of
recovering Jack, while the captain rode with
bowed head as if buried in thought. The mystery
of Jack’s fate worried him deeply, and he
was beginning to think that there were more
complications to it than he had at first imagined.</p>

<p>It was an hour after that the search party set
forth. They carried blankets, emergency kits,
food, firearms and hatchets. Also each had a
stout rawhide lariat, each “rope” being about
forty feet in length. Thus equipped they started
out on what was to prove a most eventful journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and one in which they were destined to encounter
more surprises than they dreamed.</p>

<p>By sunset the first day of their search they
found themselves in a wild canyon through
which the river flowed swiftly. Camp was made
at a spot near which a clear spring of water
gushed from a wall of the place. It was slightly
alkaline, but they did not mind that, as it was
preferable even as it was to the muddy, discolored
waters of the Rio Grande. The ponies
were picketed, a fire was lighted, supper cooked
and things put in order for the night.</p>

<p>It was not a cheerful party that gathered
about the camp fire. All of them were pretty
well exhausted and disheartened by their absolute
failure to find any trace of Jack. Captain
Atkinson alone would not admit discouragement.
He did all he could to keep up the flagging
spirits of the two lads, and after supper had
been despatched he inquired if they would care
to hear some of his experiences on the Border.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gladly,” declared Ralph, relieved to hear
something that might, for a time at least, take
his mind off the possible predicament of his
chum.</p>

<p>Captain Atkinson paused to cram his old black
pipe with strong tobacco, light it with a glowing
coal, and then plunged into his story. As he
talked the murmuring voice of the river and the
sighing of the night wind in the scanty trees of
the canyon formed a fitting accompaniment to
his narrative.</p>

<p>“Some years ago,” he began, “I was foreman
of a small ranch in the neighborhood of Las
Animos, in the eastern part of the state. It was
at a time when cattle and horse thieves, ‘rustlers’
as we call them, had been particularly active.
Hardly a rancher in the vicinity but had suffered
from their depredations, and feeling ran
pretty high against them, I can tell you.</p>

<p>“Well, our ranch, which was known as the
Flying U, had managed somehow to escape unscathed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
although all round us the rustlers had
been operating boldly and openly. Their method
was to raid a ranch, drive the cattle or horses
across the Border and then sell them to Mexican
dealers, who drove them to the coast and
there disposed of them as best they could. Many
were shipped to European ports, so I heard.</p>

<p>But it was impossible that our ranch should
long remain untouched in the midst of the general
robberies and rascality going on. Although
we guarded against it in every possible way, one
night our ‘Far Pasture’ as it was called, was
raided and a fine bunch of young steers carried
off. It was known that the leader of the band
was a man named Alvarez; but beyond this fact
and the further one that he had been a leader
in several of the frequent revolutions in his
country, we knew little about him. He was,
however, without doubt the most successful and
daring rustler that the Border was ever harassed
with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“In fact, so bold was he, and so impossible
of capture did he appear, that some of the more
superstitious men in the district began to hint
that he was of supernatural origin. Those were
wild, uncultured days, and the belief began to
spread. Every fresh raid added strength to the
rumor, until at the time of the robbery of the
Flying U I was unable to persuade anyone to
accompany me in pursuit of Alvarez; for I was
determined to take after the rascal even if the
chase led me across the Border.</p>

<p>“It may have been a foolish resolve, but I was
younger then and hot&ndash;blooded. Well, when I
found that I would have to go alone or lose valuable
time getting some men to accompany me,
I delayed no longer. I oiled up my revolver and
rifle and loaded some provisions on my saddle,
together with a roll of blankets. Then, with a
tough little pinto pony that was good for his
fifty miles a day, I took the trail.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CAPTAIN’S STORY.</p>

<p>“I soon found that I had entered on a chase
that was to prove more than I had bargained
for. Not that I had any difficulty in picking up
the trail of the stolen cattle&mdash;that part was easy
enough. I followed it all day, and at night found
myself not far from the river, in a country
creased and criss&ndash;crossed by dry gulches and arroyos.
It was a gloomy, desolate&ndash;looking place
enough, but, as it was growing dark, I had no
choice but to camp there.</p>

<p>“At the bottom of one of the arroyos I found
a muddy, ill&ndash;smelling pool of seepage water. It
did not taste good, so I fell back on what I had
in my canteen and let the pinto drink it. The
sun sank in a red ball of fire and there was a
peculiar sulphury sort of smell in the air. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
I was thinking of other things than the weather
and sat up late under the stars figuring out the
situation.</p>

<p>“The result of my mental activities was that I
decided to rest till midnight, when the moon was
high, and then plug on again. I knew the moon
would be full, and figured that I could follow
the trail all right by its light. I’ve always been
pretty well broken in to the habit of waking up
at the time I want to, and so it was within a
few minutes of twelve o’clock when I was ready
to start off once more.</p>

<p>“With my pony saddled, I mounted and was
off on the path of adventure again. All that
night I followed the trail, and by morning found
myself over the Border and in Mexico. It was
here that I decided to execute a bit of strategy.
In my kit I had, in accordance with a half&ndash;formed
scheme which had come into my mind
before I set out, placed some Mexican&ndash;looking
garments. As I spoke the language well and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was dark enough to be taken for a Mexican anyhow,
I didn’t think I’d have much difficulty in
making myself out a native of the country in
which I then was.</p>

<p>“You can readily see why I adopted this precaution.
Mexicans always have, and always will,
hate the Gringoes. They can’t help it any more
than they can help their skins being dark. It’s
bred in them, I suppose. So ‘into the enemy’s
country’ as it were, I proceeded, feeling much
more secure in my disguise.</p>

<p>“I soon had a chance to learn how nearly I
approached to the character I had assumed.
About noon that same day, after crossing a
rather barren stretch of country covered with
giant yuccas and stunted trees, I came in sight
of a clump of willows, amidst which smoke was
rising. At first my heart gave a bound. I knew
I was still on Alvarez’s trail and for an instant
I thought that he and his band were right ahead
of me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I was speedily undeceived. As I drew
closer I saw that there was an adobe hut amidst
the willows, and leaning on a gate in a tumble&ndash;down
barb wire fence was a wild, unkempt figure,
evidently that of the proprietor of the small,
lonely ranch. Beards are rare among Mexicans,
therefore I was somewhat surprised to see that
the man I was approaching had one that almost
reached his waist.</p>

<p>“On his face it reached his eyes, forming a
little mask of hair, from amid which a pair of
cunning, deep&ndash;set eyes scrutinized me closely. I
bid the fellow good&ndash;day in Mexican and asked
if I could rest and eat there, as well as obtain
hay and water for my pony. He appeared to
hesitate an instant, but then came to a sudden
resolution. He swung the gate open with surly
hospitality, and with a wave of his hand invited
me to come in.</p>

<p>“I was not slow to accept the invitation.
While he led the pony to an adobe barn in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
rear of the place I entered the house. It was
just like any other Mexican residence. Dark,
cool and bare, except for chairs and a rough
table. On the porch, roofed with willow boughs,
was the inevitable water&ndash;cooler, or ‘olla,’ of porous
earthenware. My host soon returned from
his task of stabling the horse and informed me
that he was keeping bachelor’s hall. His wife,
he said, was away visiting friends in another
part of the province.</p>

<p>“It was on the tip of my tongue to ask him
if he had seen anything of Alvarez, but I refrained,
urged to that decision by some mysterious
instinct. While the man prepared a meal
of corn paste, dried beef and frijoles, I caught
him eying me curiously once or twice. I had
told him I was a native of another province, on
my way to Santa Rosalia, a town about twenty
miles distant. I flattered myself that my disguise
was so good that the fellow had not penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
it. But in this, as you will hear, I was
grievously wrong.</p>

<p>“The rough meal being cooked, we sat down
and ate together. The man seemed a taciturn,
ugly sort of chap, and replied to my questions
in a sullen manner. Moreover, I didn’t half like
the way he kept sizing me up, as it were. But
I determined not to meet trouble half way, and
made a good meal with as stout a heart as I
could.</p>

<p>“The food despatched, I decided to push on,
and informed the man of my intention. He said
he would get my pony for me and left the place.
I was helping myself to a drink from the olla
in a gourd cup when my host reappeared. He
looked much distressed, and, on my inquiring
what was the matter, he informed me that my
pony was ‘mucho malo’ meaning that the animal
was sick.</p>

<p>“I wasted no words, but hastened to the stable.
There, sure enough, was my poor pinto in a sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
state of distress. His eyes were glassy, his coat
wet with sweat, and he was shaking in every
limb. One look at the animal was enough. I
saw in a flash that he had been poisoned.</p>

<p>“With what motive it was easy enough to
guess. The fellow had only too clearly seen
through my disguise, and, being in sympathy
with Alvarez, had determined to prevent me
from following him further.</p>

<p>“My position was about as bad as it could
well be. I was several miles from the Border
and in a part of the country entirely strange to
me. My first impulse was to attack the bearded
man and seize one of his ponies in exchange
for the one he had poisoned. But on second
thoughts I decided to move more slowly in the
matter. I guess I was aided in this determination
by the fact that while I was examining the
pony the bearded man had come stealthily into
the stable, and, looking round suddenly, I caught
him eying me intently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“’What’s the matter with the pony?’ I asked
in as easy a tone as I could assume.</p>

<p>“’Quien sabe?’ rejoined the man with a shrug
of his shoulders. He went on to say that he
thought the beast was locoed, meaning that he
had eaten ‘loco’ weed, which possesses the peculiarity
of driving horses crazy if it doesn’t kill
them.</p>

<p>“It was on the tip of my tongue to tell him
that I knew a great deal better, but I held myself
in check and appeared to agree with him.</p>

<p>“’Well,’ said I, ‘since the pony is not fit to
use, perhaps I can borrow one from you to continue
my journey?’</p>

<p>“But, not much to my surprise, he shook his
head. All his ponies, he said, were in a distant
pasture, and till his wife returned he would not
have one. He had hardly said this when there
came a shrill whinny from some nearby point.
Had the animal that uttered it meant to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the lie to his words, it could not have done so
more effectually.</p>

<p>“As it was useless to affect not to have heard
the whinny, I asked him how it was that the
noise could have been heard so plainly from a
distant pasture. He eyed me narrowly as he
rejoined that the wind must have carried the
sound.</p>

<p>“I kept my composure and merely nodded.</p>

<p>“’How far is it to the pasture?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“’Oh, quite some distance; too far to walk,’
he said.</p>

<p>“’Nevertheless, I’ll try to walk it,’ rejoined I,
‘for I must have a pony to continue my journey
with.’</p>

<p>“At this he seemed to have arrived at a bold
determination to cast all disguise aside.</p>

<p>“’Your journey stops here, beast of a Gringo!’
he shouted, and sprang at me like a tiger.</p>

<p>“Now I am of a pretty husky build, but what
with the suddenness of the attack and the really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
remarkable strength of the man, I was completely
taken off my guard. The fellow had me
by the throat and was shaking the life out of
me before I knew what had happened. What
defense I could make I did. Whether I could
have bested him or not I do not know, for in
the height of our struggling I was thrown
against the heels of my pony and the little brute
lashed out viciously. One of its hoofs struck
me, and I felt my senses go out under the blow.</p>

<p>“When I came to, I was lying in pitch darkness.
As you can imagine, it was some little
time before I could recollect just what had happened.
When remembrance rushed back I pulled
myself together and took stock. I found that
I had received a blow on the side of the head,
which, although painful, did not appear to be
so bad as might have been expected.</p>

<p>“My next step was naturally to ascertain
where I was. Groping about, I found that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in a room, and there was little doubt in my mind
that the room was in the house of the Mexican.
As I had not been bound, the inference was plain
that he had not thought it worth while to do
so because there was no way of escape from the
room.</p>

<p>“Fumbling in my pockets, I was rather surprised
to find their contents intact. My knife,
matches and money all were there. Perhaps the
bearded man had intended to rifle me at his leisure,
or perhaps he had not thought it worth while.
However that may be, I was rejoiced beyond
measure to find that at least I had the means of
making a light.</p>

<p>“I struck a match and as its yellow light flickered
up I saw that my prison place was a bare
room with whitewashed walls, one small window
high up, and a heavy door with formidable&ndash;looking
iron hinges and lock. I was approaching
the door with the intention of trying if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
was possible to effect an escape that way when
a key grated in the keyhole.</p>

<p>“At the same instant the match burned my
fingers and went out.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">RALPH’S HOUR OF DANGER.</p>

<p>“The next moment the door was flung open
and a flood of light rushed into the room. The
latter came from a lantern carried by the bearded
man, who was the individual that had unlocked
the door. In a flash it came to me to employ
the fellow’s own tactics on himself. Before he
had recovered from his evident astonishment at
seeing me on my feet, I flung myself at him like
a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>“With the lantern he could not raise his hands
in time to defend himself, and he went down
under my onslaught like a log. And then a startling
and astonishing thing occurred. My fingers
had become entangled in that monstrous beard,
and in pulling them away the mass of black hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
came with them. It was as if a mask had been
pulled off and revealed the face underneath.</p>

<p>“The countenance I then beheld was the last
on earth I expected to see just then.</p>

<p>“It was that of Alvarez himself. He snarled
like a vicious dog when he saw what I had done.
But I had him down and he could do nothing.
I forgot to mention that when he entered the
room he had with him a coil of hair rope, no
doubt intending to bind me before I should recover
consciousness. I now used this on Alvarez
while he bit and literally foamed at the mouth.
It was turning the tables with a vengeance.</p>

<p>“’Now then, you hound,’ I said, when I had
finished, ‘tell me where those cattle are and
where your ponies are, or I’ll kill you here and
now instead of taking you back across the
Border.’</p>

<p>“Of course, I had no intention of carrying
out such a threat; but I put on such a ferocious
look as I spoke that the fellow changed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a defiant, snapping wolf to a timid, cowering cur
in an instant. He begged me to save his life
and he would tell me the whole truth.</p>

<p>“’See that you do,’ I said sternly.</p>

<p>“He told me that the lonely house was used
as headquarters for his gang, all of whom were
now absent on a drive in another part of the
province.</p>

<p>“I was glad enough to hear this, for I by no
means fancied having a big fight on my hands,
which would have been the case had the rascal’s
companions reappeared. My next questions, of
course, dealt with the whereabouts of the stolen
cattle. He told me they were all rounded up
in a gulch not far from the house. I told him
that at daybreak we would go and get them and
that he should help me drive them back across
the Border.</p>

<p>“To this he readily consented and side by side
we waited for daylight. As soon as it broke we
made a hasty meal, I having to feed my prisoner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
for I dared not release his hands. This done,
I ordered him to set out ahead of me and show
me the way to the secret cañon where the cattle
were cached. First, however, I made him take
me to where the ponies were picketed in a corral
at the bottom of an arroyo. It was not more
than a few hundred yards from the house, but
so well concealed that if I had not heard one
of the animals whinny, as I told you, I should
never have guessed at its existence. Before setting
out, too, I looked my pinto over and was
glad to see that he appeared to be getting over
the effects of the poisonous dose.</p>

<p>“I tied Alvarez’s feet together under his
pony’s body and made him ride in front of me
all the way to a range of low hills, in which he
said lay the place were the stolen cattle were
‘cached’ before being driven to the coast. It
was a wild and desolate&ndash;looking spot, but after
traversing the foothills of the dreary range we
came to a valley in which there was a stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and a plentiful crop of wild oats and bunch
grass. Feeding placidly amongst these was a
bunch of cattle which I instantly recognized as
those I was in search of.</p>

<p>“I made Alvarez help me round them up and
then began a drive the like of which I never participated
in before. We stopped at the ranch
house on the return journey for the pinto, who
was, by this time, strong enough to be led behind
one of the other ponies. What a drive that
was! Besides watching the cattle, I had to keep
a constant eye on Alvarez, whom I had determined
to bring back a captive to the States.</p>

<p>“But in spite of all my vigilance the tricky
fellow escaped me. Rightly judging that I valued
the cattle more than his worthless hide, he
waited till we reached the vicinity of the Border.
Then, taking his opportunity when the cattle
were restless, he struck spurs to his horse and,
tied as he was, dashed off. I fired after him,
but that did not stop him. The last I saw of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
him was a cloud of dust. It would have been
useless to pursue him, so I devoted myself to
the cattle, and the next night brought them home
again safe and sound.</p>

<p>“Soon after that I became a Ranger, and have
remained one ever since. I’d like to tell you
lads other tales of the Border, but it is late and
we must make an early start, so now&mdash;good&ndash;night.”</p>

<p>“Good&ndash;night,” echoed the boys, who had listened
with the deepest interest to the grizzled
Ranger’s story, “we shall dream of that lone
ranch house.”</p>

<p>“I often do, I can assure you,” rejoined Captain
Atkinson, with a laugh. “I wonder if Alvarez
does. I’ve never heard of him from that
day to this, except that I did hear some place
that he had become a revolutionary leader in
Mexico.”</p>

<p>At the moment Captain Atkinson little imagined
how close he was to a second meeting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the notorious Alvarez, revolutionist and cattle
rustler.</p>

<p class="ls1 large">********</p>

<p>Jack flung himself face downward on the turf
at the crest of the precipice he had so miraculously
conquered. His senses were swimming,
his lungs felt as if they would burst, his heart
beat wildly, shaking his frame. In truth the boy
had come perilously close to the limit of endurance.
The feat he had accomplished would have
been a test to a hardened Border man, let alone
a youth.</p>

<p>For the first few minutes Jack felt a deep
conviction that he was going to die&mdash;and he
didn’t much care. But as life came back he
struggled to his feet and began to look about
him. First he peered down into the valley he
had left to see if he could signal Alvarez and
give him to understand that he was bringing
help if possible. But deep purple shadows now
obscured the valley floor, and he could see nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the drama that was taking place below
him.</p>

<p>It will be recalled, of course, that we left Alvarez
thunderstruck at the approach of three figures
along the valley from the direction of the
Pool of Death. This was just after he had
watched Jack’s speck&ndash;like form vanish over the
cliff top. For the sake of clearness we will now
relate what took place in the valley following
Alvarez’s discovery of the approach of the newcomers,
and then go on to tell what befell Jack
after his recovery from exhaustion.</p>

<p>Alvarez kept his eyes fixed in wonderment on
the trio as they came down the valley. All at
once he recognized one, slightly in advance, with
a cry of astonishment. At the same instant Captain
Atkinson, for it was he, recognized Alvarez.
For an instant neither spoke, and the two lads
accompanying the captain, who, as the reader
will have guessed, were Ralph Stetson and Walt
Phelps, also came to a halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter, captain?” inquired Ralph,
regarding the Mexican with some astonishment,
for his perturbation was only too evident.</p>

<p>“Why, boys, of all the adventures that have
befallen us since we set out to look for Jack this
is the most surprising.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” inquired Ralph.</p>

<p>“Simply that this man before us is the very
Alvarez about whom I told you the other night.”</p>

<p>But the reader must be wondering how the
captain of the Rangers and the two lads came
to be in the inaccessible valley. To explain this
we must, at the risk of being tedious, go back
a few hours.</p>

<p>The morning following Captain Atkinson’s
narration of his experience with Alvarez the
trail had once more been taken up. Before many
hours had passed the searchers came to the fork
in the Rio, and stopped almost nonplussed. They
had no means of judging whether the boat or
raft which they believed had carried off Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
had gone down the Rio or had been swept down
the branch stream.</p>

<p>The question was decided in an ingenious manner
by Captain Atkinson. Some distance above
the fork in the stream lay a big log near the
water’s edge. Doubtless it had been carried
down in some freshet. At any rate, to the
Ranger’s shrewd mind it suggested a way of
solving the problem. Under his direction the
boys rolled it into the stream, wading out with
it as far as they dared.</p>

<p>Then they watched it as the river swept it
along. At the fork a current caught the log and
whirled it off down the branch stream.</p>

<p>“That decides it,” declared Captain Atkinson,
“we will follow the fork of the Rio. If Jack
was on anything that floated it would have been
swept from the main stream in the same way as
that log.”</p>

<p>They then proceeded to find a way to cross the
main stream so as to get on the bank of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
branch current. They soon found a ford about
a mile up the river. After some cautious reconnoitering
Captain Atkinson decided to cross the
stream at that point. But he warned the boys
that they might have to swim with their horses
before they reached the other side.</p>

<p>“It is impossible to tell if there aren’t deep
holes in the middle of the stream,” he said. “In
case we do flounder into any of them just fling
yourself from the saddle, keeping hold of the
pommel. Then let the ponies do the rest and
they will land you safe and sound.”</p>

<p>For the first few yards all went well. The
water came up to the ponies’ withers, but it did
not appear to get deeper. Ralph was just congratulating
himself that they would get across
with ease and safety if things continued that way
when his pony suddenly floundered into a deep
hole. Instantly it lost its footing and went clear
under.</p>

<p>Ralph had not time to extricate his feet from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the stirrups, and was carried with it. As he
vanished from view under the turbid current an
alarmed cry broke from both Captain Atkinson
and Walt Phelps.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">A “BLANK WALL.”</p>

<p>“He’s drowning!” cried Walt in alarmed tones.</p>

<p>“It is just as I feared,” cried Captain Atkinson,
“the pony struck a water hole and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Look, there’s the pony now!” cried Walt as
the little animal reappeared and began swimming
for the bank.</p>

<p>“But where is Ralph?”</p>

<p>Without waiting to make any reply to Captain
Atkinson, Walt suddenly wheeled his pony.
Down the stream he had seen an arm extended
above the muddy current. He knew that it was
Ralph’s.</p>

<p>There was no hesitation in the boy’s manner
as he turned his pony, and, plunging the spurs
in deep, drove him through the water. All at
once Walt and his pony floundered into the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
hole that had been Ralph’s undoing. At the same
instant a sudden swirl of the current caught
Ralph, who, though half drowned, was making
a brave struggle. The momentary halt was the
chance that Captain Atkinson had been looking
for.</p>

<p>He had followed close on Walt’s heels and
now, while the latter was struggling to maintain
a hold on his swimming pony, the captain of the
Rangers uncoiled his lariat.</p>

<p>Swish! It shot out in a long rolling coil and
fell fairly about the shoulders of the struggling
Ralph Stetson. Although half choked into insensibility
with the water he had swallowed,
Ralph still maintained enough sense to grasp the
rawhide while Captain Atkinson drew it tight.</p>

<p>When the coil was fast the captain backed his
pony upstream until Ralph had been dragged to
shallow water. Then he pulled him out and laid
him on the bank, gasping and almost drowned.
In the meantime Walt Phelps had succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
extricating himself from his perilous position,
and he and his pony, drenched through and dripping,
arrived on the bank almost at the same time
as Ralph was dragged ashore.</p>

<p>Captain Atkinson had some simple remedies
in his kit and he applied these to Ralph, who was
soon able, as he put it, “to sit up and take notice.”
As he did so the stumbling pony, which
had been the cause of all the trouble, came up
and sniffed at his master curiously.</p>

<p>“Well, Spot&ndash;nose,” said Ralph, using the name
he had given the little beast, “you almost caused
me to find a watery grave.”</p>

<p>The pony whinnied as if to show that he was
sorry and was willing to apologize. This view
of the circumstance made them all laugh. By
this time Captain Atkinson had a roaring fire
going, by the side of which they dried themselves,
and there was soon a decidedly more
cheerful tone to the party.</p>

<p>“It makes me shiver, though, when I think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
that narrow escape,” said Ralph as they prepared
to continue their journey.</p>

<p>“That is just an incident of life here on the
Border,” declared Captain Atkinson. “It’s such
things as those that make a man or a boy know
that there is a divine Providence watching over
us. No man who has lived on the desert or at
sea doubts that there is a watchful eye upon us,
saving by seeming miracles from disaster and
death.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” agreed Walt soberly, “I’ve often
heard my father say that the best cure for religious
doubts is to have a man come out here
on the Borderland. He says that heaven and
earth are closer here than in the cities or in the
more civilized portions of the country.”</p>

<p>They rode on, following the branch of the Rio,
tracing, although they did not at the time know
it, the course of the runaway raft on which Jack
had made his wild trip.</p>

<p>It was late that afternoon that they came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the falls that thundered down into the Pool of
Death.</p>

<p>Awe&ndash;struck by the wild and gloomy majesty
of the scene, not one of the party spoke for a
time. It was Walt who broke the silence, shouting
above the mighty roaring of the falls.</p>

<p>“Can Jack have gone over this cataract and
lived?” he said.</p>

<p>Captain Atkinson shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p>“It looks bad,” he said. “If the boy was
plunged over such a place only one of those miracles
of which we spoke awhile back can have
saved his life.”</p>

<p>“How can we reach the foot of the falls?”
asked Ralph in a quavery tone.</p>

<p>The sublimity of the scene and its suggestion
of ruthless power and pitiless force had overawed
him.</p>

<p>“We must look about for a way,” declared
Captain Atkinson, “at any rate we won’t turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
back till we know, or at least are reasonably certain,
of Jack’s fate.”</p>

<p>For some time they searched about the summit
of the steep cliffs surrounding the Pool of Death
without coming on any path or series of ledges
by which they could hope to gain the foot of the
falls. But at last Captain Atkinson halted by
a rock that towered up like a pinnacle or obelisk.
It stood at the edge of the cliffs, at a spot where
they did not appear more than a hundred feet
or so high.</p>

<p>“We might be able to get down from here,”
he decided.</p>

<p>The boys peered over the edge of the cliff. It
was perpendicular and steep as a wall. It was
hard to imagine even a fly maintaining a hold
on it.</p>

<p>But they knew that Captain Atkinson was not
the man to speak without reason, and so they
respectfully waited for him to continue.</p>

<p>“I estimate the height of this cliff at a trifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
under one hundred feet,” he said, “therefore we
have a means of getting to the bottom.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how,” rejoined Ralph.</p>

<p>“My boy, you will never make a Ranger if you
can’t make the best of a situation,” said Captain
Atkinson in a tone of mild reproof. “We have
the three lariats. Their united length is one
hundred and twenty feet. That will allow us a
chance to knot some sticks into the united ropes
and thus make a sort of rope ladder. We can
secure it ’round this spindle&ndash;shaped rock and so
reach the foot of the falls without much difficulty.”</p>

<p>The boys hailed the idea with enthusiasm,
Ralph saying:</p>

<p>“Well, I am a chucklehead. Why on earth
didn’t I think of that?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re not a full&ndash;fledged Texas
Ranger,” laughed Walt. “I guess there’s more
to being a Ranger than we thought.”</p>

<p>“I guess there is,” agreed Ralph contritely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The three ropes were fetched from the saddles
and one long one made out of them. Then stout
sticks were knotted in at long intervals so as to
form a rough kind of ladder.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said Captain Atkinson, when he
had fastened the rope about the obelisk&ndash;shaped
rock, “I will go first and test it.”</p>

<p>“Would it not be better if one of us, who are
lighter, took your place?” asked Ralph, unwilling
to see the daring Texas Ranger risk his life.</p>

<p>“No. It is my duty to go first. If it will bear
me, it will bear you.”</p>

<p>So saying, Captain Atkinson began that thrilling
descent. The boys, lying flat, with their
heads extended over the rim of the Pool of
Death, watched him till he reached the ground.
They could not restrain a cheer when they saw
that the feat had been accomplished in safety.
In response Captain Atkinson waved his hand
up to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, boys, it is your turn,” he cried encouragingly.</p>

<p>After a moment’s argument, for each wished
the other to have the honor of going first, Ralph
was persuaded to make the descent. He reached
the ground safely, and was soon standing beside
Captain Atkinson. Then came Walt’s turn, after
which the three adventurers were united.</p>

<p>“What an awful place!” shuddered Ralph,
glancing about him nervously.</p>

<p>“Yes, let us be pushing on. It is high time
we&mdash;Great heavens, look here!”</p>

<p>The captain had stopped abruptly at the rock
on which Jack had dried out his dripping garments.
What he had seen had been the ashes
of the fire the lad had kindled.</p>

<p>“Some one has lit a fire here,” cried Ralph as
he, too, saw the embers.</p>

<p>“Yes, and not long ago, either.”</p>

<p>Captain Atkinson bent over and picked up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
handful of the blackened embers, examining
them carefully.</p>

<p>“This fire is not over forty&ndash;eight hours old,”
he exclaimed in a voice that fairly shook with
suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“And that means that Jack has&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“In some miraculous way been swept over
those falls and survived. Let us press on at
once. Before dark we may have him with us
again.”</p>

<p>At these words new life seemed to course
through the veins of the two exhausted young
Rangers. They plucked up energy and courage
from the captain’s manner.</p>

<p>“Forward,” cried their leader, plunging into
the narrow passage which we have seen Jack
traverse.</p>

<p>Entering the valley, they had hardly gotten
over the first shock of their surprise at its extent
and formation when the keen eyes of Captain
Atkinson discovered the figure of the Mexican.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“What can this mean?” he exclaimed. “Yonder
is a man watching us. Let us go up to him
at once and find out what this means; perhaps
Jack has found friends; perhaps the valley is inhabited.”</p>

<p>It was a moment later that the scene of recognition
which we have described took place.</p>

<p>“How came you here, señors?” demanded the
Mexican, who, seemingly, was the first to recover
his self&ndash;possession.</p>

<p>For reply Captain Atkinson whipped out his
revolver with incredible swiftness and leveled
it at the fellow’s head.</p>

<p>“Speak the truth, Alvarez,” he snapped, “or
it will be the worse for you. Where is Jack
Merrill?”</p>

<p>“If you mean the boy who was dashed over
the falls with me,” was the reply, “he has gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone?”</p>

<p>“Si, señor.”</p>

<p>“Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Quien sabe.”</p>

<p>“Answer me quick, Alvarez.”</p>

<p>The brow of Captain Atkinson puckered angrily,
his countenance grew dark.</p>

<p>“It is as I say, señor. What object would I
have in lying to you? The boy climbed yonder
cliff but this minute and has vanished.”</p>

<p>Although they would have liked to disbelieve
the fellow’s story, and incredible as it seemed
that a human being could have climbed that cliff,
there was an unmistakable ring of sincerity in
the man’s tone; it was impossible to make light
of his tale.</p>

<p>“Boys, we have run against a blank wall,”
spoke Captain Atkinson at length, with heavy
anxiety in his tone.</p>

<p>“Do you think Jack is safe?” breathed Ralph.</p>

<p>“Heaven, in whose power he is, alone knows,”
was the earnest rejoinder.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">LOST IN THE BURNING DESERT.</p>

<p>Jack’s first thought when he rose to his feet
had been, as we know, to signal the Mexican
whom he had left behind him, and try to assure
him by sign language that he would do all in
his power to bring rescuers to the valley. Not
that the boy had any particular affection for the
swarthy Alvarez; but naturally, with his warm,
forgiving temperament, he hated the idea of
leaving a fellow being behind without hope of
succor.</p>

<p>But the dark shadows of evening hid the valley
from him, and the boy was forced to set forward
without having had a chance to signal the
Mexican, or to witness a scene that would have
interested him in an extraordinary degree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
namely, the arrival of his chums and Captain
Atkinson.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, the first thing that Jack
did when he found himself at the top of the
dread precipice was to look about him and see
what kind of country it was into which he had
fallen, or rather, climbed. While it was rapidly
growing dark in the valley below, the sun still
shone brightly on the heights above, although
the luminary of day was not far from the
horizon.</p>

<p>So far as Jack could see, the country round
about was not dissimilar in the main from that
across the Border. It was a rolling country,
grown with bunch grass and here and there a
ghostly&ndash;looking yucca stretching its gaunt arms
out against the sky. As far as the eye could
reach this sort of country extended, except that
in the distance was a purplish mass of what
might have been either mountains or low&ndash;lying
clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>But to the boy’s dismay there was not a sign
of a human dwelling, nor of anything to indicate
that life existed in that dreary plain.</p>

<p>“Gracious,” thought Jack, “this is really
serious. I feel weak for want of food and I’m
thirsty enough to drink a well dry. Surely,
there must be some human beings in the vicinity.
At least I’ll not give up hope.”</p>

<p>With a great sigh the boy struck out toward
the east. He chose this direction because he
thought it was as good as any other, and not
for any particular reason. He trudged pluckily
on across arid, rocky plains till the sun sank in
a blaze of copper and gold behind his back.</p>

<p>It was then, and not till then, that Jack gave
way. He flung himself down despairingly on
the hot ground under the cheerless arms of a
huge yucca.</p>

<p>“What is to become of me?” he cried in a
dismayed tone. “What shall I do? Evidently
this part of the country is good for neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
ranching or mining, and is uninhabited. I might
tramp on for days without finding a soul to help
me. Am I doomed to end my life in this dreary
place?”</p>

<p>These and a hundred other gloomy thoughts
flitted through the boy’s mind as, utterly exhausted
and unnerved, he lay on the ground beneath
the yucca. What were his chums doing?
he wondered. No doubt by this time a search
party had been organized to seek for him, but
Jack owned, with a sinking of the heart, that it
was beyond the range of possibilities, almost,
that they should ever find the Pool of Death
and the secret valley.</p>

<p>“No,” he owned with bitter resignation, “my
bones will bleach in this God&ndash;forgotten place,
and none will ever know my fate.”</p>

<p>Then he thought of his home and his father,
the stalwart ranchman, and tears welled up in
his eyes and a great lump rose in his throat.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s hard to have to die like this,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
moaned, “and yet there is nothing to be done.
True, I may live for a day or two yet. I can
start out again to&ndash;morrow morning and go on
stumbling along till I drop exhausted.”</p>

<p>It was at this bitter moment that a sudden
recollection of a favorite saying of his father’s
came into the boy’s mind: “Never give up while
you’ve a kick left in you.”</p>

<p>Jack thought of the bluff ranchman as the saying
came back to him with poignant force.</p>

<p>“Never give up while you’ve a kick left in
you.”</p>

<p>“For shame, Jack Merrill,” he said half aloud,
“for shame, to be giving up this way. You’ve
a kick left in you, many of them perhaps. What
would your dad say if he saw you sitting down
like a girl or a baby and giving in before you
had to? Don’t you dare to do it again.”</p>

<p>Having thus scolded himself, Jack felt somewhat
better, though there was still the great
dread of a death in the desert upon him. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
at least some of his spirit had returned. He
resolved to struggle on as soon as he was sufficiently
rested.</p>

<p>With this determination in his mind, the boy
tried to compose himself for sleep. He knew
that a good spell of slumber would refresh him
almost as much as food or drink. Thus he unconsciously
echoed the sentiments of the philosopher
who declared that “He who sleeps, dines.”</p>

<p>At any rate, the practical Jack Merrill wished
to be at his best when he started off once more
on his wanderings, so he laid down and composed
himself as comfortably as he could. Strange as
it may seem that he could sleep under such conditions,
slumber he did, although all sorts of wild
dreams beset his rest. At one moment he was
toiling over a burning desert under a pitiless
sun, calling aloud for water. Then again he
was in the shade of a delightful group of trees
while bright crystal springs flashed and rippled.
He was dreaming that he felt the delightful cooling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
sensation of a cold plunge into one of these
rivulets when he awoke with a start.</p>

<p>Above him the stars glittered coldly. The
yuccas, like grim sentinels, outstretched their
gaunt, semaphore&ndash;like arms against the night
sky. A breeze that seemed chilly after the heat
of the day swept the dismal plain. The sensation
of coming from that dream of cool green
places to that dry, desolate, stony waste gave
Jack a fresh shock; but, true to his determination
to act as he knew his father would wish
him to do, he shook off his gloomy depression
and struck out once more toward the east, taking
his direction from the North Star, which he
sighted by means of the “pointers” in the Dipper.</p>

<p>As he strode forward the poor boy whistled
“Marching Thro’ Georgia” to keep up his spirits.
But the tune soon wavered and died out. His
lips were too dry and cracked to make whistling
anything but a painful process. Thereafter he
trudged along in silence. Soon a rosy flush appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
in the east, and before long the sun rushed
up and it was a new day.</p>

<p>But to Jack the coming of the sun meant fresh
disappointment. He had hoped that with daylight
he might perceive some house, however
rough, or at least a road he could follow. But
none appeared. He mounted to the highest bit
of rocky land he could find in the vicinity in the
hope that the elevation might aid him in surveying
the country.</p>

<p>It did give him a wider outlook, it is true, but
the extended range of vision brought no glad
tidings of civilization to the boy. Nothing but
that same dreary expanse of brush, yuccas, sand
and rocks met his eye.</p>

<p>Jack set his teeth grimly. He faced the truth
now squarely and without flinching. Unless by
some miracle a human being came that way he
was doomed. There was no evading the fact.
Already his thirst had passed the uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
stage and had become a mad craving for water.</p>

<p>He tried cutting the yucca stalks and extracting
some moisture from them. But though they
yielded some acrid juice, it did little to assuage
his pangs. It was about a mile from the spot
where he had mounted the little hill that Jack’s
collapse came. For some time before he had
been certain that his mind was acting strangely.
He was distinctly conscious of another self, a
second Jack Merrill walking by his side. He
talked wildly to this visionary being. His talk
was like the ravings of a boy in a high fever.</p>

<p>So weak had he become that the last mile had
taken more than an hour to traverse. Hardly
conscious of what he was doing, the boy had
toiled doggedly on. But as the sun grew higher
his strength grew less. At last his knees fairly
buckled under him and he sank down in that
stony, sun&ndash;bitten place, utterly incapable of further
locomotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is the end,” he muttered, through scorched
and blackened lips, as he sank, “oh, great
heavens, it is the end!”</p>

<p>The sun beat pitilessly down on his form as
it lay there in that shadeless expanse. Tiny lizards
darted in and out among the scanty, dusty
brush and glanced speculatively at him with their
tiny bright eyes.</p>

<p>High in the burning blue vault of the sky a
buzzard paused in its ceaseless wheelings, and,
gazing down, saw that motionless form. By the
magic that summons these birds of prey the sky
above Jack’s still form was soon filled with them.</p>

<p>For a time they swung round and round; but
gradually the boldest, from mere dots high in the
air, became great black&ndash;winged birds with foul
looking heads of bare red flesh and hideous
curved beaks. First one and then another
dropped to the ground a short distance from the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>They hopped in a curious flopping fashion
about him.</p>

<p>“Was the boy dead?” That was the question
that they asked themselves as they eyed his still
form with greedy, deep&ndash;set eyes.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">TWO MEN OF THE AIR.</p>

<p>The news that all their trouble had gone for
naught, and that Jack had himself placed his
rescue beyond their hands, struck the three newcomers
to the valley dumb for an instant. But
at last Captain Atkinson spoke:</p>

<p>“Of course, you have not forgotten me, Alvarez?”</p>

<p>“That is hardly likely, señor capitan,” rejoined
Alvarez, a slight smile playing across his
swarthy features; “one does not forget such encounters
as our last one.”</p>

<p>“So I perceive. But this time you will not
escape so easily. You are to consider yourself
my prisoner.”</p>

<p>The Mexican shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not in a position to attempt to escape,”
he said resignedly.</p>

<p>“How did you come to be in this valley with
Jack Merrill?” was the next question.</p>

<p>Alvarez, who doubtless saw that his best
course was to tell the truth, launched into a fairly
accurate account of the adventures on the raft,
and the thrilling descent into the Pool of Death.
Ralph Stetson shuddered as he listened. Walt
looked almost incredulous. It seemed hard to
believe that any human being could have “shot”
that awful cataract and lived.</p>

<p>By this time it was dark, and, as it would have
been too dangerous to attempt using the improvised
rope ladder at night, Captain Atkinson decided
to camp where they were. Alvarez was
not bound, as his captors deemed it impossible
for him to escape. Instead, he sat around the
fire with them, and to anyone not knowing the
circumstances he appeared more like a friend or
a member of the party than an alien prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>But they had not counted on the wily ways of
the ex&ndash;cattle rustler. Even Captain Atkinson,
old plainsman as he was, was completely taken
in by the seeming resignation of Alvarez to his
fate. For this reason no guard was placed on
the man that night. This Captain Atkinson was
to regret bitterly some hours later, for, when
day dawned, there was no sign of Alvarez.</p>

<p>The Ranger guessed the truth at once. Alvarez
had overheard their talk about the rope
ladder and the ponies which had been left
tethered in the grass at the falls. There was not
the slightest doubt that he had made use of the
ladder in the night, and helped himself to one of
the ponies. If he had not taken all three they
would be lucky, thought the captain.</p>

<p>The boys were anxious to set off in pursuit of
the escaped prisoner at once, but Captain Atkinson
made them prepare and eat a scanty breakfast
first.</p>

<p>“Alvarez must be miles away by this time,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
said, “that is, provided he made the climb in
safety.”</p>

<p>After breakfast no time was lost in striking
out for the falls. The ladder was just as they
had left it, except that one of the cross sticks
had snapped, showing that someone must have
climbed it in the darkness and missed his footing.</p>

<p>“We are at least fortunate that he left the
ladder,” said Captain Atkinson. “I had a half&ndash;formed
fear that he would have destroyed it.”</p>

<p>“Surely he would not have done such a dastardly
thing as that!” exclaimed Walt.</p>

<p>“All is fair in love and war, you know,” rejoined
the Captain with a smile, “and Alvarez
is at war with us.”</p>

<p>“I’m not bothering so much about him,” said
Ralph with a sigh, “in fact, I think it was good
riddance of bad rubbish to lose him. It’s poor
Jack I’m worrying about.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope that he has found his way to
a settlement and that by this time he is on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
way back to camp,” said Captain Atkinson cheerfully.
“Why, it’s even possible that he may get
there ahead of us.”</p>

<p>The cheery tones of their leader greatly heartened
both the lads and the climb up the ladder
was made in good spirits. As soon as they
reached the surface they hurried to where the
ponies had been tethered. Walt and Jack’s animals
were both there, but the captain’s had gone.
Pinned to one of the saddles was a hastily
scribbled note on a bit of paper seemingly torn
from an old account book.</p>

<p>Captain Atkinson unfolded this missive and
read it aloud. It was in Spanish, but he translated
as he went along.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pn1">“Dear Señor Capitan:</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for your consideration
in leaving me a pony and allowing me a chance
to get out of that odious valley. Adios; possibly
we may meet again; till which time I am your
devoted servant and humble admirer.</p>

<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Alvarez.</span>”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“Well,” laughed the captain, “that’s a characteristic
bit of Mexican writing. A man steals
your horse and breaks his parole and then signs
himself ‘your devoted servant.’”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done now?” asked Walt.</p>

<p>“We shall have to take turns riding the remaining
ponies double. It will make our progress
slow, but it is the only thing to be done.
Let us lose no more time but saddle up and get
started at once.”</p>

<p>This was done; and half an hour later the
three travelers had left beyond ear&ndash;shot the
sound of the falls that thundered unceasingly
into the Pool of Death.</p>

<p class="ls1 large">********</p>

<p>The boldest of the unclean birds that surrounded
Jack’s unconscious form were quite
close to him when in the air above, where some
others were still wheeling about before descending,
there came a sudden disturbance and flapping
of wings. High above the highest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
circling buzzards was what at first appeared to
be merely a larger bird of prey. But a second
glance would have shown that besides size, this
new winged creature possessed many other points
of difference from the bird creation. Behind it
streaked out a long trail of blue smoke, and it
could be seen that seated in it, between the wings,
were the figures of two men. It was, in fact, an
aeroplane of the biplane type, powerfully engined
and commissioned by the Mexican government
for use as a scout ship to spy out the haunts
of the rebels.</p>

<p>Its two occupants were Lieut. José Sancho and
Lieut. Manuel Diaz of the Mexican army. They
had been flying since daybreak, scouting the
country thoroughly in search of information of
the rebels’ whereabouts. The great flock of buzzards
had attracted their attention, and Lieut.
Sancho, who was at the wheel, while his comrade
scanned the country through field glasses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
had steered the airship in the direction of the
great birds.</p>

<p>“Can you see anything?” he asked Lieut. Diaz
as the airship drove in among the birds, scaring
them off with hoarse cries.</p>

<p>“Yes. There is something on the ground.”</p>

<p>“It must be some dead animal. No human
being could have found his way into this miserable
desert.”</p>

<p>Lieut. Sancho was about to put the airship on
its course once more when his brother officer
gave a startled exclamation.</p>

<p>“By the saints!” he exclaimed, “this is
strange.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, what attracted those buzzards was no
dead steer or horse.”</p>

<p>“What then was it?”</p>

<p>“The figure of a boy or a man lying face
downward.”</p>

<p>“Is he dead, do you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“It is impossible to tell.”</p>

<p>“Shall we descend and see?”</p>

<p>“We might as well, although, to speak the
truth, I can’t conceive that anyone could have
wandered into this desert and lived.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. Still it is our duty to find out.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. Let us land on that little hillock
yonder and then we can make an examination.”</p>

<p>Down swooped the great airship, landing
without a jar on the bare little hill Lieut. Diaz
had mentioned.</p>

<p>As soon as the craft touched the ground the
two Mexican officers were out of it, and, after
attending to the motor, hastened over the sandy
soil to Jack’s side.</p>

<p>“<i>Santa Maria!</i> It is but a boy,” exclaimed
Lieut. Sancho as he turned the inanimate form
over.</p>

<p>“<i>Todos los Santos</i>, so it is. A fine&ndash;looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
fellow, too. But is there any trace of life in
him?”</p>

<p>For answer Lieut. Sancho shook his head
mournfully.</p>

<p>“I fear we have come too late,” he said, bending
over Jack to try to catch the least flicker of
life.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SANDSTORM.</p>

<p>His companion produced a tiny mirror, part
of a pocket toilet set he carried. Lieut. Sancho
took it and held it over Jack’s lips.</p>

<p>“Praise the saints, there is still life in him.
See!”</p>

<p>He held up the mirror for his companion’s inspection.
It was blurred faintly, showing that
the boy was still breathing.</p>

<p>“Get the emergency outfit,” was the next order
of the young Mexican officer, and his companion
soon produced the required kit from a
box under the seat of the military biplane.</p>

<p>The kit was the same as used by the armies
of most civilized nations. It contained, besides
bandages and antiseptics for wounds, stimulants
and other drugs. Forcing Jack’s lips open, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
lieutenant gave him some stimulant, and was rewarded
before long by a faint stirring on the
part of the boy.</p>

<p>He redoubled his efforts to revive him, and
soon had the satisfaction of seeing the boy’s eyes
open and stare wildly about him. Not more than
ten minutes later Jack was sipping a cup of water
and explaining, between gulps, how he came to
be in such a predicament. The officers listened
with interest and nodded appreciatively as the
boy told his story.</p>

<p>“This Alvarez is one of the most dangerous
of the revolutionaries,” declared Lieut. Sancho.
“Since President Madero’s accession he has kept
things in the province stirred up in constant turmoil.”</p>

<p>“His presence in this part of the country
shows that the rebel troops cannot be far off,”
struck in Lieut. Diaz, “so that we have to thank
our young friend here for some valuable information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“And I have to thank you for my life,” exclaimed
Jack warmly. “I don’t know how to
thank you.”</p>

<p>“By consenting, if you feel strong enough, to
take a ride with us in our aeroplane. What
you told us about Alvarez makes me anxious to
be off as soon as possible. If he is still in that
valley we can capture him, and that will be a
crushing blow to the revolutionaries.”</p>

<p>Jack had seen aeroplanes before, but never at
as close range as this military one. It was
painted a dark olive, with wings of a dull gray
color, the object being to make it as inconspicuous
as possible. It had a powerful six&ndash;cylinder
motor and was driven by twin propellers. It
was built to carry two, but there was room on
a folding seat for a third passenger. Jack was
told to occupy this extra seat and then Lieut.
Sancho and his comrade climbed on board.</p>

<p>“Hold tight!” cried Lieut. Sancho as he
started his engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Steady as Jack’s nerves usually were, he felt
rather alarmed at the uproar that ensued. From
the exhaust pipes of the motor smoke and flame
shot viciously. The slender fabric of the aeroplane
shook tremulously as the pulsations of the
mighty engine racked its frame.</p>

<p>But suddenly another sound broke in&mdash;a sound
that Jack had heard too often before not to recognize
it instantly.</p>

<p>It was the song of a bullet&mdash;the long drawn
ze&ndash;e&ndash;e&ndash;ee of a rifle projectile.</p>

<p>The two officers were as swift to hear the
sound as Jack. Glancing up, the three beheld
simultaneously a body of horsemen sweeping
down on them from a range of barren&ndash;looking
hills in the distance. As they rode they fired
till a perfect fusilade of bullets was whistling
around the aeroplane.</p>

<p>They were a wild&ndash;looking body of men. Most
of them wore the sugar loaf or cone&ndash;peaked hat
of the Mestizo, and their serapes streamed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in the breeze behind them. Dust and sweat covered
their ponies, and a great cloud of gray dust
enveloped them.</p>

<p>“<i>Viva Alvarez!</i>” they cried as they swept on.</p>

<p>Lieut. Sancho saw that to resist them would
be hopeless. Instead he devoted all his efforts
to starting his motor. At last, just as the foremost
of the horsemen were upon them, the aeroplane
gave a jump forward and scudded off like
a live thing over the crowd.</p>

<p>This sudden motion of the great winged man&ndash;made
bird so terrified the ponies of the rebels,
for a detachment of the revolutionists they were,
that the little creatures became uncontrollable
and dashed off in every direction. All the shouts
and curses of their owners failed to rally them,
and after running a few hundred feet the aeroplane
soared aloft, unharmed except for a few
bullet holes in her planes.</p>

<p>The sensation was a delightful one. As the
bumping motion caused by the run over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
ground ceased, it felt to Jack as if he was riding
on billows of the softest cloud fabric. He had
not the slightest fear and watched Lieut. Sancho
with interest while he manipulated the various
levers and wheels. As they flew the officer
showed Jack just how the air craft worked. He
even let him take the wheel for an instant, and
declared that the boy acquitted himself like a
born airman. The aeroplane being fitted with
stability devices of automatic construction, it
was, of course, possible to do this, where in another
sort of air machine it might have been
dangerous to allow a novice to handle the control
wheel.</p>

<p>As they rose higher Jack cast a look back.
The country was stretched out like a panorama
beneath him. On the plain he could see the detachment
of revolutionaries galloping about trying
in vain to reform their disorganized ranks.</p>

<p>“See if you can point out this wonderful valley
of yours,” said Lieut. Diaz presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Before long Jack sighted the hidden valley
which had been the scene of his thrilling climb.
He recognized it by the tumbling cascade of
water that thundered whitely into the Pool of
Death.</p>

<p>“There! There it is yonder!” he cried.</p>

<p>“It is indeed a wonderful place,” commented
Lieut. Sancho as they hovered like a huge eagle
above the cliff&ndash;walled valley. “If one did not
know of it, it would be impossible to discover it.”</p>

<p>“Except by airship or by the Pool of Death,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>Lieut. Sancho finally spied a good place to land
and the aeroplane was dropped rapidly into the
valley. It settled with hardly a jar or a quiver,
much to Jack’s astonishment, who had feared it
would collide with the ground with considerable
force.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see anything of your friend Alvarez,”
commented Lieut. Sancho, looking about
him after they had left the aeroplane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nor do I,” commented Jack in a rather astonished
tone, “what can have become of him?”</p>

<p>“Possibly he has escaped in some way. He is
as cunning a fox as there is in the country,” declared
Lieut. Diaz.</p>

<p>Jack shook his head, however.</p>

<p>“There is no chance that he could have gotten
out unless he followed my path and I think he
was not active enough for that.”</p>

<p>“Which way did you get out?” inquired Lieut.
Diaz. “Where is that cliff you told us about?”</p>

<p>Jack pointed to the frowning precipice he had
scaled. The officers, who could hardly be blamed
for doubting him, gazed at the boy sharply. But
his frank, honest countenance and modest manner
of telling his story soon put their suspicions
to rout, although Lieut. Diaz frankly confessed:</p>

<p>“Señor, you are an American boy, and therefore
tell the truth; but from anyone else we
should have laughed at the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“It was nothing to laugh at, I assure you,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“I should imagine not,” agreed Lieut. Sancho,
“one would hardly think a fly could find footing
on that place.”</p>

<p>“Looking up at it now,” said Jack with a
laugh, “I myself begin to doubt that I did it.”</p>

<p>A systematic search of the valley was begun,
and of course ended without result. One thing
only was certain, Alvarez had gone. It was a
good thing possibly that Jack did not know then
the manner of his going, or what part the boy’s
own friends had played in it. Had he done so,
he would have felt very downcast over the
thought of by how narrow a margin he had
missed being reunited to them.</p>

<p>“Well,” declared Lieut. Diaz as they came to
a halt near the Pool of Death, “one thing is as
certain as daylight, and that is that in some manner
Alvarez has escaped.”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it. But how?” rejoined his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
companion. “I confess I am at a complete loss
to understand how he effected his release.”</p>

<p>“Maybe another aeroplane came along and
took him,” suggested Jack. “That is the only
thing I can think of.”</p>

<p>Entirely mystified, the two officers made arrangements
for flight once more. It had been
agreed that Jack was to be landed in the
Rangers’ camp, or, at any rate, close to it. The
prospect of rejoining his friends safe and sound
rejoiced the boy, and he was in high spirits when
they sat down to partake of lunch before resuming
flight.</p>

<p>They had concluded their meal when Jack noticed
that there was a peculiar look about the
sky. From blue it had turned to a yellowish
tinge, and the sun glowed through it like a fiery
copper ball. He drew the attention of Lieut.
Sancho to this, and the young officer and his
comrade in arms held a long consultation about
the state of the weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>At its conclusion Lieut. Sancho announced
that, although the weather appeared threatening,
yet they would go up. He explained that he and
his companion had to be back at their headquarters
in time to report the rebel attack and
the near approach of the reactionary forces. If
they were to drop Jack on the way, there was
no time to be lost.</p>

<p>The aeroplane was swiftly tuned up, and when
all were on board Lieut. Diaz, who had relieved
Lieut. Sancho at the wheel, sent the big craft up
with a velocity that made Jack lose his breath.
At a height of about two hundred feet a sudden
gust struck the air craft, causing it to careen in
a most alarming manner. For one dread instant
it appeared to Jack that the whole affair
was doomed to turn turtle in mid&ndash;air; but the
stability devices worked just in time.</p>

<p>With a clicking and sliding sound the parts
that composed the balancing power of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
machine slipped into their places and it resumed
an even keel.</p>

<p>As if to show his perfect mastery of the military
dirigible, Lieut. Diaz drove it straight up
toward the overcast sky. A fairly stiff wind was
now beginning to blow, and to Jack the maneuver
appeared risky in the extreme. But, of
course, he said nothing, although, looking downward,
earth looked fearfully remote. But to the
two Mexican officers all this was evidently part
of the day’s work. At all events, neither of
them displayed the least anxiety; on the contrary,
Lieut. Sancho was busy noting the action
of the barograph and barometer, and jotting
down the results of his observations in a small
notebook.</p>

<p>All at once Jack, on glancing down, discovered
that the earth had been obliterated. A yellow
fog, or it seemed to be fog, hid the surface of
the country from them. All at once something
stinging struck the boy’s face. It was sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>With a gasp of alarm Jack realized that a
sandstorm was raging below them. He recalled
the one near La Hacheta, in which the lads had
seen the flight of the ghostly camels. Seriously
alarmed, he drew the attention of his companions
to what was going on. By this time, so
rapidly had the velocity of the wind increased
that it was blowing half a gale, great clouds
of sand swept bewilderingly round them. The
aeroplane pitched and swayed like a ship in an
angry sea. Jack held on tight, thinking that
every moment would be likely to be his last.</p>

<p>“We did wrong to come up so high,” admitted
Lieut. Diaz.</p>

<p>“But you are going higher?” objected Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes. We must avoid that sand at all hazards.
It won’t be so bad higher up, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Why not drop to earth right now? It’s all
flat country hereabouts,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“In the first place, the sand would blind us
and we would crash to earth and be wrecked, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
all probability. In the second place, if even a
little sand got into our engine it would ruin it,”
rejoined the officer.</p>

<p>Jack said no more. He felt rather ashamed, in
fact, of having showed his agitation so plainly.
After all, the officers knew far more about aeroplanes
than he did, and perhaps there was a
chance that they would get through safely yet,
He fervently prayed that they might.</p>

<p>Lieut. Diaz sat grimly at the wheel, driving
the aeroplane ever upward. Jack watched him
admiringly. Not a trace of fear or of any other
emotion had flickered across his steadfast countenance
since the battle with the storm had
begun.</p>

<p>They had driven their way far above the yellow
sand fog and were battling with the wind at
an altitude of almost seven thousand feet, when
Lieut. Diaz gave a sudden gasp. He turned
deadly pale and lurched forward in his seat. Had
not Lieut. Sancho caught him, he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
toppled off into space. The aeroplane, released
from a controlling hand, gave a sickening dash
downward.</p>

<p>“Wha&ndash;what has happened?” gasped Jack, genuinely
alarmed now.</p>

<p>“It’s air sickness! Seize that controlling handle
and do just as I tell you. All our lives may
depend on it!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE BATTLE AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE.</p>

<p>Air sickness! With the words there flashed
through Jack’s mind a recollection of having read
somewhere about that strange malady of the
upper regions which sometimes seizes airmen,
paralyzing temporarily their every faculty.</p>

<p>While the thought was still in his mind he had
seized the wheel and awaited the next orders
from Lieut. Sancho, who was holding the unconscious
form of Lieut. Diaz in the machine.</p>

<p>“Push that lever forward&mdash;so! Now a twist
of your wheel to the left. <i>Bueno!</i> You are a
born airman.”</p>

<p>Jack wished he could think so, too. From
sheer nervousness the sweat stood out upon him,
his hands shook and his pulses throbbed.</p>

<p>But the consciousness that all their lives depended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
upon his keeping cool and obeying orders
steadied him. By a supreme effort he mastered
his jumping nerves and obeyed the lieutenant’s
orders implicitly.</p>

<p>To his actual surprise, for he did not think
it would have been so easy to handle an air
craft, the winged machine righted itself as he
manipulated the lever and wheel. Before many
seconds it was driving along on an even keel
once more. But in its fall it had entered the
region of driving sand again. Pitilessly, like
needle&ndash;pointed hailstones, the sharp grains drove
about them, pricking their flesh.</p>

<p>“Up! We must go up higher!” cried Lieut.
Sancho. “Pull back that lever. Now your
wheel to the right&mdash;that sets the rising warping
appliances! There! That’s it! Now your foot
on the engine accelerator! Good! You are an
aviator already.”</p>

<p>As Jack put the lieutenant’s commands into
execution one after another the desired effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
was procured. The aeroplane began to rise,
fighting its way up through that inferno of yellow
sand. Jack feared that at any moment his
eyes would be rendered useless, but he stuck to
his task without flinching.</p>

<p>At last in the upper regions, they winged along
free from the ordeal of the whirling sand spouts,
but still in the grasp of the furious wind.</p>

<p>“Can we not land?” asked Jack after a time.
“Surely it would be safer.”</p>

<p>“Safer, doubtless, once we could get to earth;
but it would be madness to attempt a landing in
this wind.”</p>

<p>“Then we must stay up here till the wind subsides?”</p>

<p>“Yes, or at least until the sand thins out. We
should be blinded if we got into the thick of it,
let alone the danger to our engine.”</p>

<p>“What speed are we making?” was Jack’s next
question.</p>

<p>“About fifty miles an hour, possibly more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Then we may be driven miles out of our
way?”</p>

<p>“I fear that is possible. But see, Lieut. Diaz
appears to be reviving. Can you reach me that
medical kit?”</p>

<p>Jack, not without being fearful of the consequences
of his taking one hand from the controlling
devices, did so. Luckily, as we know,
the aeroplane was equipped with the latest stability
devices, making her comparatively steady
compared to the older fashioned craft of the air.
Jack’s maneuver, therefore, was not so risky as
might have been thought.</p>

<p>While the aeroplane bucked and plunged its
way through the storm Lieut. Sancho administered
stimulants to Lieut. Diaz, who presently
began to recover from his spell of air sickness
almost as rapidly as he had been “taken down”
with it. It is a peculiarity of such seizures, in
fact, that they are not of long duration. Some
authorities have held that there are poisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
strata in the air which cause the sickness and
on emerging from them the victim becomes well
again. However that may be, Lieut. Diaz was
soon himself, and Jack was relieved at the wheel
by Lieut. Sancho.</p>

<p>“How far do you imagine we have been
driven?” he asked as the officer took the wheel.</p>

<p>“That is impossible to say, <i>amigo</i> Jack. I directed
you while you were in control of the ship
so that as far as possible we should maneuver
in circles. Judging by that, we ought not to be
much more than fifty miles or so out of our
way.”</p>

<p>This was cheering news to Jack, who had begun
to imagine that they had been driven half
way to the Gulf of Mexico at least. As this
would have meant a lot of delay in rejoining his
comrades, he was naturally worried. For an
hour or so more they swung in circles above
the storm, and then the furious gale began to
lessen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>As the wind fell the sand “fog” below began
to melt away just as if it had actually been mist.
Its dissolving brought a view of a stretch of
country not unlike that in which the Rangers
had been camped when Jack had last seen them.</p>

<p>Below them shone the river between its precipitous
banks, and on one side of it Jack could
see a small, rough&ndash;looking settlement. On the
outskirts was a low red building, the shape and
form of which at once showed it to be a schoolhouse,
even if the Stars and Stripes had not
been floating on a pole before the door. The
aeroplane was still hovering in the air above the
little settlement when the schoolhouse door
opened and out rushed teacher and pupils in
evident excitement. They gazed upward at the
winged man&ndash;bird in a state of the greatest wonderment.</p>

<p>Suddenly from across the river came a perfect
tempest of shots and yells. Looking down, Jack
saw that a body of horsemen was galloping for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
dear life toward the ford at the river. Close
behind them came some more mounted men, although
the latter were dressed in uniforms, suggesting
that they were regulars. Evidently they
were in pursuit of the ragged&ndash;looking Mestizos
who were making for the ford.</p>

<p>On they came at a furious gallop. Gazing
from above, Lieut. Sancho announced that the
band being pursued was a band of rebels, while
the men in pursuit were part of the regular cavalry
of the Mexican government.</p>

<p>“But they are fleeing on to American soil!”
exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>“Si, señor Jack. Evidently the rascally rebels
think that if they can gain the protection of the
Stars and Stripes they will be safe.”</p>

<p>Jack could not help feeling sympathy for the
ragged band that was being so remorselessly
pursued, even though he knew that the rebels
had wrought all sorts of outrages, both on American
soil and in their own country. For instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
only a short time before a band of cattle had
been driven from an American ranch to feed the
starving revolutionary troops.</p>

<p>But such thoughts as these were soon interrupted
by the boy’s absorbed interest in the
drama taking place far below them. From the
town a few men had come running at the sound
of the shooting, but as they saw the armed men
come sweeping through the ford they beat a
hasty retreat. Only the school teacher, a pretty
young girl, so far as Jack could see, and her
little flock stood their ground.</p>

<p>Having crossed the ford the pursued Mestizos
did not draw rein. Instead, they urged their
ponies on still more furiously. The clatter of
their hoofs even reached to the aeroplane, which
was swinging about in the blue ether some thousands
of feet above.</p>

<p>All at once Jack, with a quick intake of his
breath, divined their purpose. The hounded band
of revolutionaries was spurring and lashing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the schoolhouse. Their evident purpose was to
seek refuge within it, under the protection of
Old Glory.</p>

<p>But what of the children and their young
teacher? In case there should be firing, their
position would be a terrible one. As the first
of the rebel band dashed into the schoolhouse enclosure
and the teacher and her pupils fled
within in terror, Jack begged Lieut. Sancho to
descend.</p>

<p>“In case the Federals open fire on the schoolhouse
many of those children will be killed,” he
cried anxiously.</p>

<p>Lieut. Sancho nodded.</p>

<p>“I doubt if we can be of much use,” he said,
“but at any rate we will drop down and see what
can be done.”</p>

<p>The aeroplane instantly began to descend, but
before it was half way down the last of the
refugees had dashed into the schoolhouse, and
the door was slammed to and bolted. The Federals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
close on the fugitives’ heels, withdrew to
a short distance for a parley when they perceived
this. From the schoolhouse windows a few scattering
shots followed them, but none of them
took effect.</p>

<p>But the men who had done the shooting had
perceived the approach of the aeroplane, which
was now quite close to the ground. It was probably
the first they had ever seen and they gazed
at it with awe and some superstitious terror.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” called one of them.</p>

<p>“What shall we tell them?” Lieut. Sancho
whispered to Jack.</p>

<p>“Tell them to let the teacher and her scholars
out of there at once or we will dynamite the
place,” replied Jack without hesitation.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell them that if they don’t, we shall drop
a bomb from the aeroplane,” whispered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea. Let’s hope it will scare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
them into releasing the children and their
teacher.”</p>

<p>Lieut. Sancho shouted his ultimatum at the
men at the schoolhouse windows, at the same
time leaning down as if to pick up some sort of
weapon. Doubtless the unfamiliarity of such a
war machine as an aeroplane had something to
do with it; but at any rate, after some anxious
deliberation, during which the aeroplane hovered
at closer range, the door was opened and the
teacher and her little flock emerged.</p>

<p>“Now run to the town. Run for your lives,”
cried Jack as they came out, and the pretty girl
and her pupils were not slow to obey the injunction.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Federals, withdrawn to
a little distance, had viewed the operations with
amazement. They had been too much excited
by the chase to notice the aeroplane till it was
at close range. Now they gazed at it with wonder
and then broke into a cheer. At first Jack was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
astonished at this enthusiasm, but then he suddenly
recollected that inscribed on the machine’s
upper and lower planes were the arms of the
Mexican Republic.</p>

<p>“Viva! Viva, Madero!” yelled the regulars,
as the aeroplane swung above them.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with those rascals
in the schoolhouse?” yelled down Lieut. Sancho
to the officer in charge of the Federals as the
great winged machine sailed majestically by over
their heads.</p>

<p>“Assault the place and capture it,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“You forget that it is on American territory
and that our government will be liable for any
outrages inflicted on this side of the Border,”
was the rejoinder. “I will guarantee to get them
out of there in far more peaceable fashion.”</p>

<p>“Very well, señor lieutenant, as you will,” was
the reply of the officer, given with a shrug of the
shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I wonder what’s going to happen
now?” thought Jack as the aeroplane was headed
back at top speed for the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>“Diaz, will you do me the favor to get that
round black bottle out of the medicine kit?” said
Lieut. Sancho in calm tones as he guided the air
craft toward the stronghold and retreat of the
rebel force.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pch">WHERE STRATEGY WON OUT.</p>

<p>Their coming was viewed by a dozen swarthy
faces thrust out of the schoolhouse windows.
As the aeroplane drew near the building Lieut.
Sancho raised his voice above the humming of
the engine.</p>

<p>In a loud authoritative tone he called for attention.</p>

<p>“If that schoolhouse is not vacated inside of
five minutes,” he snapped out, “I shall dynamite
it.”</p>

<p>A derisive chorus of yells greeted this, although
a few voices could be heard begging the
officer to have mercy.</p>

<p>“Hand me that ‘bomb,’ Diaz,” ordered the officer
as the aeroplane came in full view of the
schoolhouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Seizing this opportunity, Lieut. Sancho manipulated
the air craft with one hand while he apparently
examined the “bomb” with deep attention.
He took good care while doing this to
handle it so that it might be plainly seen by the
Mestizos.</p>

<p>The aeroplane continued its flight above the
schoolhouse roof, and then, swinging round, was
driven back again. As they came over for the
second time Lieut. Sancho hailed the recalcitrants
once more.</p>

<p>“Throw your rifles and weapons out of the
windows or I’ll drop the bomb. The five minutes
is almost up.”</p>

<p>This time there was no answer but a sullen
roar. Apparently the occupants of the schoolhouse
were quarreling among each other. The
aeroplane was flown a short distance and then
turned for another flight toward the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>“Here, take the wheel, Diaz,” ordered Lieut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Sancho. “I’m going to let them see that we
mean business.”</p>

<p>With Lieut. Diaz at the wheel, his brother
officer manipulated the “bomb” in truly alarming
manner. Bending low over it and striking a
match, he appeared to light its fuse. Then, holding
on to a brace, he half rose out of his seat,
and as they neared the schoolhouse he raised his
arm as if poising the “bomb” before hurling it.</p>

<p>It was too much for the nerves of the besieged.
With wild cries to Lieut. Sancho not to kill them,
they began casting their rifles and revolvers out
of the windows in a perfect hail. Lieut. Sancho
appeared to stay his hand, but was still menacing.</p>

<p>“Todos! Todos!” (“All! All!”)</p>

<p>He shouted this as they thundered close above
the schoolhouse roof. As he did so the schoolhouse
door was opened and out rushed the terrified,
demoralized Mestizos, who were swiftly
made prisoners by the Federals without their
offering more than a nominal resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>By the time the last had been captured, while
the aeroplane drew close to the scene, from the
town, whence the proceedings had been watched
with interest, several citizens came running, now
that all the danger of bullets seemed to be past.</p>

<p>“Well, after what I’ve seen,” declared Jack,
“never tell me that the aeroplane isn’t any good
in warfare. To&ndash;day it averted what might have
been a bloody fight, and, as it was, not a man
was even scratched, except in his feelings. By
the way, Lieutenant, what was in that ‘bomb’?”</p>

<p>“A very deadly mixture,” laughed the officer
in return, “a solution of Epsom salts!”</p>

<p>“Here I be, the mayor of that thar berg back
thar,” said an individual with a bristly straw&ndash;colored
mustache, hastening up. “What be all
these here connipations a&ndash;goin’ on out hyar?”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Mayor,” rejoined Jack, “these two
gentlemen are officers of the Mexican Federal
troops detailed to aerial duty.”</p>

<p>“Waal, what be they doin’ this side of ther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Border? I’ve a good mind ter put ’em in ther
calaboose, the dern long&ndash;horns,” declared the
mayor angrily.</p>

<p>“Inasmuch as they saved a lot of children and
their teacher from rough treatment by a band of
rebels, I don’t think that would be very fair,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted the mayor, “I was comin’
out hyar to git ther mavericks on ther run myself,
but I had an attack of indigestion.”</p>

<p>“I guess that was when you heard the shooting,”
thought Jack to himself.</p>

<p>Aloud, though, he continued:</p>

<p>“The Mestizos were captured by as clever a
ruse as can be imagined, Mr. Mayor.”</p>

<p>“Eh, how’s that, young feller?”</p>

<p>“By a bottle of Epsom salts.”</p>

<p>“Say, see here, kid, it ain’t healthy ter git
funny with yer elders in these hyar parts.”</p>

<p>“It’s the exact truth, I assure you,” declared
Jack smilingly, quite ignoring the mayor’s frown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
He went on to tell the full details of the fight,
or rather the argument, and when he had finished
not one of the assembled crowd was there
that did not join in the laugh.</p>

<p>“An’ how did you come to be hyar, young feller?”
asked the mayor at the conclusion of Jack’s
story. “You beant a greaser.”</p>

<p>“No, but I have found that there are a few
brave and clever men on the other side of the
line, too,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“Ther kid’s right,” assented one or two in the
crowd.</p>

<p>Jack then told as much of his adventures as
he thought necessary, and at the conclusion the
delighted mayor clapped him on the back so
heartily that the breath was almost driven out
of his body.</p>

<p>“I’ll give yer all ther liberty of Go ’long,” he
said, sweeping his hand back toward his little
principality.</p>

<p>But the two Mexican officers were obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
refuse the mayor’s hospitality. A short time
after the Federal troops had departed with their
prisoners of war the two airmen winged their
way southward to their headquarters.</p>

<p>As for Jack, he had ascertained that San Mercedes
was only twenty miles or so off, so he determined
to hire a horse and ride over there early
in the morning. That night he slept in a bed for
the first time in many long hours, and with his
anxieties cleared away and his heart light, his
slumbers were deep and dreamless. He was
awakened by the ubiquitous mayor, who was
also the hotel&ndash;keeper. Incidentally, the pretty
school teacher turned out to be his daughter.
Her enthusiastic praises of Jack the night before
had made the boy blush hotly, but that was nothing
to his embarrassment a few moments later
when the town band, consisting of a cornet and
a drum, headed a procession to the hotel and he
had been compelled to give a speech.</p>

<p>Jack felt glad on waking that all that was over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and that in a short time he would be on his way
back to his friends in the camp of the Rangers.
The town of Go ’long did not offer much in the
way of a menu beyond blackstrap and hot cakes,
beans, bacon and black coffee, but Jack made a
hearty meal on these frontier delicacies, after
which he was informed that his pony was at the
door.</p>

<p>His landlord, whose name, by the way, was
Jerry Dolittle, refused to take a cent from the
boy, and told him that when the Rangers came
that way next his old friend, Captain Atkinson,
could return him the pony.</p>

<p>The greater part of the population of Go ’long
had accompanied Jack about a mile on his way,
but soon he was ambling along alone with a
straight road in front of him. Naturally his
mind was busy with speculations as to what had
occurred in the camp during his long absence
from it.</p>

<p>“Good old Walt! Dear old Ralph! Won’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
they be glad to see me!” he mused as he rode
along across the plains; “won’t I be glad to see
them, too! Gracious, what a lot we shall have
to talk about! I won’t blame them if they don’t
believe half of it. I can hardly believe it myself
sometimes, and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>Between San Mercedes and Go ’long the rough
road led through one of those peculiarly desolate
ranges of hills common in that part of our country.
As Jack’s pony began to mount into the recesses
of these gloomy, barren hills, the lad knew
that he had come a dozen miles or so from the
Go ’long hotel.</p>

<p>The road wound along the bottom of the steep,
sandy gullies, which were in some places streaked
gorgeously with strata of various colors, red,
blue and bright orange. Above burned a sky of
brilliant blue. It would have made a splendid
subject for the canvas of an impressionistic
painter.</p>

<p>Jack knew that somewhere within these hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
he ought to meet the daily stage that ran between
San Mercedes and Go ’long. At least, such had
been the information given him before he set out
from the latter place. He was quite anxious to
see it, as on his lonely ride he had not encountered
a human face. The solitary nature of the
barren hills through which he was now riding
depressed him, too, with a sense of remoteness
and lonesomeness.</p>

<p>As Jack rode he commented to himself on the
rugged character of the scenery. The road,
which would have hardly been dignified with the
name of a trail in the east, crawled along the
side of the bare hills, in some places overhanging
gloomy canyons.</p>

<p>“This must be a dangerous place to drive a
stage,” thought Jack as he passed by a big rock
and found himself traversing a bit of road which
bordered the edge of a mountain spur, with a
precipice on one side and a deep canyon on the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, had the lad known it, that particular
bit of road was reputed to be about the worst
even in that wild land. Should the horses make
a misstep on the trail, instant death to every occupant
of the coach must result.</p>

<p>There were few drivers, even the most reckless,
that cared to go at more than a snail’s pace
over that stretch of road even with the quietest
team. True, the passage had been made on one
occasion at night, but that was for a wild and
foolish bet and the authorities had put a stop to
any more such practices. So that Jack was not
far out when he mentally appraised that bit of
road as being as dangerous and nasty a track to
negotiate as he had ever seen; and Jack had seen
a good deal of the wild southwest.</p>

<p>The boy had passed the dangerous bit of road
and was jogging along in a deep divide between
two ranges, when he was startled by a sudden
sound right ahead of him.</p>

<p>It was unmistakably a shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>A rifle shot, too, the boy judged. He spurred
forward rapidly, not knowing well just what to
expect when he should round a curve in the road
just ahead.</p>

<p>It did flash into his mind that his landlord at
Go ’long had spoken of the coach being held up
occasionally, but Jack had placed little stock in
the stories. In fact, he rather inclined to think
that old Jerry was telling them with the idea of
getting a rise out of a Tenderfoot.</p>

<p>Still, there were a few mines in that part of
the country and occasionally gold was shipped
through to Go ’long, which was not far from
the main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p>But Jack had only made a few paces forward
on his quickened mount when three other shots
rang out in rapid succession.</p>

<p>“Now I am perfectly sure there is trouble on
the trail ahead!” exclaimed Jack to himself,
urging his pony forward at a yet faster gait.</p>

<p>The idea of personal danger did not enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Jack’s head, although the scene that he beheld as
he swept round the curve on his galloping pony
might well have alarmed an older hand than he.</p>

<p>Coming toward him at a hard gallop was the
Go ’long coach. Its six horses were in a lather
of perspiration, and the coach was swaying
wildly from side to side.</p>

<p>From the top of the coach a fusilade was being
fired at three men in pursuit of the vehicle.
These latter appeared to be returning the fire
with good will.</p>

<p>At almost the same moment that his eye took
in these details Jack became aware that, besides
the driver of the stage, there were three other
occupants on the roof.</p>

<p>These were Captain Atkinson of the Rangers,
Ralph Stetson and Walt Phelps.</p>

<p>As he perceived all this Jack drew his pony
back on his haunches and waited whatever might
turn up, for it was his determination to aid his
friends.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE STAGE HOLD&ndash;UP.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack saw the driver lurch forward
in his seat. Perhaps he had been killed, perhaps
he was only badly injured.</p>

<p>Instantly Jack’s mind was made up. Snatching
off his hat, he waved it about his head.</p>

<p>At the same time he turned in his saddle and
yelled back down the trail, as if a numerous band
was coming round the turn:</p>

<p>“Come on, boys! Hurry up and we’ll get
them!”</p>

<p>The pursuers of the coach stopped suddenly.
Then they wheeled their ponies about and dashed
off at top speed. Jack’s ruse had succeeded.
Evidently the highwaymen thought that a large
body of horsemen was behind Jack. At any rate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
they deemed it more prudent not to wait to find
out.</p>

<p>But only one serious aspect of the situation
was relieved by the abrupt departure of the highwaymen.
The limp form of the coachman hung
on the box, almost toppling off the seat. The
lines had dropped from his hands and lay on
the backs of the terrified wheelers. On they
came, thundering at runaway speed, while Jack
hesitated, his mind full of the thought of that
dangerous bit of road that lay ahead.</p>

<p>He shouted up to his companions on the roof:</p>

<p>“Hullo, boys! I’m with you again!”</p>

<p>There was a yell of joy. An answer to his
hail came quickly.</p>

<p>“Jack Merrill, by all that’s wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Jack! How under the sun did he get here!”</p>

<p>“It’s Jack on deck again as usual!”</p>

<p>But Jack heard none of these joyous exclamations.
He had turned his horse almost on its
haunches, owing to the narrowness of the trail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
In one swift flash of inspiration he had made up
his mind as to the course he would pursue in
checking the runaways.</p>

<p>He spurred his pony alongside the wheelers,
crying out in as soothing a tone as he could:</p>

<p>“Whoa, boys! Whoa, there!”</p>

<p>But the terrified animals paid no attention to
him, nor had he much expected that they
would. He only spoke to them in order that
he might not frighten them worse when he
spurred his pony alongside them.</p>

<p>He might have ridden in front of them, but
the risk of causing them to swerve and precipitate
the whole coach from the trail was too great.
The most dangerous part of the road lay about
a mile ahead. If only he could check the team
before they reached it, all might be well; if not&mdash;well,
Jack did not dare to think of what would
be the consequences in such a case. Thus began
a mad, dangerous ride, a ride of grave risk
to the daring young Border Boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Of one thing he was thankful&mdash;the pony under
him was a sure&ndash;footed, fast little beast, and
perfectly broken, a rare thing in that part of
our country. This made it possible for Jack to
loop his own reins about the saddle horn and
then, leaning out of the saddle, to seize the lines
which the wounded driver had dropped.</p>

<p>This done, he began to pull gently on them,
taking care not to terrify the runaways further
by jerking on their bits. Bracing himself in his
stirrups, Jack exerted a steady pressure on the
reins, at the same time using every means he
knew of to soothe the maddened beasts.</p>

<p>“Good boy, Jack! Good boy!” breathed Captain
Atkinson from the roof of the coach, while
he lifted the stricken stage driver to a place of
safety. “Boys, Jack will save us yet,” he added,
turning to his young companions.</p>

<p>“You can bet on him every time,” came admiringly
from Ralph. “He’ll conquer them yet.”</p>

<p>But had Ralph known of the danger place that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
lay not so far ahead now, he might not have been
so confident.</p>

<p>“Put on the brake!” Jack shouted back over
his shoulder as they tore along that dangerous
trail.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! Why didn’t I think of that?”
exclaimed Captain Atkinson.</p>

<p>Handing the driver over to the care of the
boys, he clambered into the former’s seat, and,
placing his foot on the heavy California&ndash;style
brake, he jammed it down with all his force.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Jack as the wheels screeched
and groaned.</p>

<p>The horses appeared more terrified than ever
at the racket made by the brake, but it was strong
enough to check their speed perceptibly, struggle
as they would.</p>

<p>A short distance further came a little rise, beyond
which lay the dangerous spot that Jack
dreaded. The rise completed what the brake had
begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re slackening speed, Jack!” cried Captain
Atkinson.</p>

<p>“They are, indeed!” hurled back Jack. “I
think I’ll have them under control in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>Jack’s words came true, but none too soon. A
few seconds more and they would have reached
the curve, beyond which lay the bit of narrow
road. A thrill ran through Jack’s frame as he
drew tight on the reins and felt the tired animals
slow up to a trot and then, obedient to his voice,
come to a halt, sweating and trembling, with
distended nostrils.</p>

<p>Jack lost no time in riding round to the heads
of the leaders and holding tightly on to them.
But there was little fight left in the horses.
Dragging the coach with its locked brake up that
hill had thoroughly exhausted them; they seemed
glad to rest.</p>

<p>“Get out, boys!” shouted Jack. “Come and
give me a hand to uncouple the traces. I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
think they’ll run again, but we won’t take
chances.”</p>

<p>In an instant Ralph Stetson and Walt Phelps
had sprung to the ground and one on either side
of the coach were running forward to help Jack
complete one of the bravest tasks a boy ever set
himself to perform.</p>

<p>Naturally, it was not till the horses were
calmed down that they had a chance to talk. In
the meantime the stage driver, whose name was
Jed Hoster, had been revived and was found to
be painfully but not seriously injured. He had
been shot through the shoulder.</p>

<p>We are not going to relate all that took place
at that odd reunion in the heart of the Ragged
Range, as the barren hills were called. Every
one of my readers can picture for himself what
a confusion of tongues reigned as the boys all
tried to talk at once, and relate their many adventures
since last they had met.</p>

<p>After awhile the coach, with Captain Atkinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
at the “ribbons” and Jack riding close alongside,
was driven to a broad part of the road and
then turned around, as San Mercedes was closer
to the spot where the attack had occurred than
was Go ’long.</p>

<p>Captain Atkinson told the boys that he had
not the least idea who the men that made the
attack could have been, but surmised that they
must have possessed information that the coach
was carrying a consignment of gold dust from
a desert mine for shipment at Go ’long.</p>

<p>“Had it not been for your smart trick, Jack,”
he declared, “we should never have got off as
easily as we did.”</p>

<p>A sharp lookout was kept all the way back
to San Mercedes for another sight of the would&ndash;be
robbers. But nothing more was seen of them,
and the return journey was made without incident.
There was much rejoicing in the camp of
the Rangers over the safe return of Jack, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
even Shorty appeared to be glad that the boy had
come unscathed through so many perils.</p>

<p>That was a gala night in camp. Songs and
stories filled the time till far into the night. The
three boys, who possessed remarkably good
voices, sang several popular songs and were
much applauded. At last they had to stop from
sheer weariness.</p>

<p>Each lad was anxious to go out on duty along
the Rio Grande that same evening, but Captain
Atkinson sternly forbade them doing so.</p>

<p>“You turn into your blankets and get a good
sleep,” he ordered. “I’ve got another job on
hand for you to&ndash;morrow and I want you to be
fresh when you tackle it.”</p>

<p>Much mystified and not a little excited at these
words, the boys obediently turned in and were
soon sound asleep. They were astir bright and
early the next morning&mdash;just as the last patrol
of the night was coming in, in fact. The night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
had been an eventless one, they learned, the
rebels having given no sign of their presence.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast Captain Atkinson approached
the boys, who were polishing up their
saddles and bits, accompanied by a tall, bronze&ndash;bearded
man, whose tanned skin and keen gray
eyes bespoke him a dweller in the open places.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Lionel Reeves, the rancher, of
whom you may have heard,” he said. “Mr.
Reeves, these are the lads of whom I spoke to
you.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you could not have picked better
young fellows for the task you wish accomplished,”
spoke Mr. Reeves, shaking hands
warmly with each of the boys in turn. “By the
way, do they know about it?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” rejoined Captain Atkinson, with
a smile at the eager looks that three pairs of eyes
turned on him.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="pch">OFF ON A MISSION.</p>

<p>“Mr. Reeves lives on the Rio Grande about
fifty miles from here,” went on Captain Atkinson,
while the boys listened eagerly, feeling that
they were on the verge of some fresh adventure.
“He has, as you may know, one of the biggest
cattle ranches in this part of Texas. Word has
been brought to him that the rebel army of Mexico,
which is hard up for food, has planned a
raid on his ranch to drive off a band of cattle.”</p>

<p>The boys nodded attentively, but as there was
no necessity for speech they said nothing.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” continued the captain of the
Rangers, “most of his punchers are off on another
of his ranges rounding up stock for shipment
on a rush order. That leaves the Border
ranch practically unprotected. Mr. Reeves is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
old friend of mine, and has come to ask me for
aid. I cannot spare any of my men, as I need
them all to patrol this part of the river. I have
offered, subject to your consent, of course, your
services to Mr. Reeves. You will rank as
Rangers yourselves while performing patrol duty
at Lagunitas Rancho. Will you go?”</p>

<p>Would they? The cheer that went up was
more than ample evidence that the Border Boys
fairly leaped at the chance. Captain Atkinson
went on to explain that their duties would be to
watch the cattle at night and instantly give the
alarm if anything out of the way occurred.</p>

<p>“But mind,” he warned, with a half humorous
look playing about his mouth, “mind, you are not
to get into any danger.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, captain,” chorused three voices in
unison.</p>

<p>“I am not so sure about that,” rejoined Captain
Atkinson. “You Border Boys appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
have a remarkable faculty for getting into
scrapes of all kinds.”</p>

<p>“But, then, we always get out of them again,”
struck in Walt Phelps quite seriously, at which
both Captain Atkinson and Mr. Reeves and the
boys themselves had to laugh.</p>

<p>“Do we start right away?” asked Walt
anxiously.</p>

<p>“No; not until to&ndash;morrow morning. Mr.
Reeves, however, will go on ahead. I will give
full instructions as to the road to take and there
will be no chance of your being lost.”</p>

<p>“As if we couldn’t find the road,” whispered
Ralph indignantly to Walt. “That would be
a fine thing for full&ndash;fledged Rangers to do,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>Soon after, Mr. Reeves said good&ndash;bye, as he
had a long ride ahead of him and could not expect
to arrive home much before midnight. The
rest of that day the boys spent in getting their
outfits ready. Baldy showed them how to do up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
their kits in real Ranger fashion. In the town
the boys also procured for themselves Ranger
hats and gauntlets, so that when the time came
for their departure the next morning they were
three as doughty looking Rangers as could have
been found along the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>“Good&ndash;bye, boys,” were Captain Atkinson’s
parting words. “Keep out of danger and remember
that you are going on Rangers’ work
as Texas Rangers.”</p>

<p>“We won’t forget,” called back Jack, with a
hearty ring in his voice.</p>

<p>“So&ndash;long! Yip&ndash;ye&ndash;e&ndash;e&ndash;ee!” yelled the Rangers.</p>

<p>“Yip! Yip!” shouted the boys.</p>

<p>Their three ponies bounded forward, and in
a cloud of dust they clattered through the town
and out upon the plains upon the trail for Lagunitas
Rancho.</p>

<p>As they had a long trip before them, they did
not ride fast after they had passed the town
limits, but allowed their ponies to adopt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
easy, single&ndash;footed gait known all over the west
as the “cow trot.” At noon they halted by some
giant cottonwood trees to eat the lunch they had
brought with them. Large clumps of bright
green grass grew in great profusion all about,
and the boys decided to let the ponies graze while
they ate. They made a hearty meal, washing
it down with water from their canteens. These
canteens were covered with felt, which had been
well soaked with water before leaving camp.</p>

<p>The evaporation from the wet felt as the hot
sun struck it kept the fluid within the canteens
fairly cool.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! I just hate to go out into the hot
sun again,” declared Walt Phelps, throwing himself
down on the ground and luxuriating in the
shade.</p>

<p>“Same here, but we’ve got to be pressing forward
if we are to go on duty to&ndash;night,” declared
Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thunderation!” fairly shouted Ralph, “do we
have to go on duty to&ndash;night?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. You didn’t think we were going
to Lagunitas for a vacation, did you?” inquired
Jack with a smile.</p>

<p>“N&ndash;n&ndash;no,” stammered Ralph, looking rather
shamefaced, “but I thought we’d have a rest before
we started in.”</p>

<p>“I reckon Rangers do their work first and rest
afterward. Isn’t that the way, Jack?” asked
Walt.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s it,” was the reply. “But let’s
go and get the cayuses and saddle up.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose what must be, must be,” muttered
Ralph, with a groan at the idea of leaving
the friendly cottonwoods.</p>

<p>The three lads rose to their feet and looked
about them. To their dumbfounded amazement
no ponies were to be seen.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, what can have become of them?”
cried Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stolen, maybe,” suggested Ralph.</p>


<p>“How on earth could that be? No one came
near while we were resting.”</p>

<p>“But they are not to be seen,” objected Walt.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, they are,” cried Jack suddenly.
“Look, they are all lying down out yonder.”</p>

<p>“Gracious, they lie as if they were&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;” began
Walt, when Ralph interrupted him with a sharp
cry of:</p>

<p>“Dead!”</p>

<p>In a moment the boys were at the side of their
little mounts. The animals lay stretched out as
if they had not an ounce of life in their bodies.
But their hearts could be seen beating, and their
nostrils moved as the breath passed in and out;
so it was quite evident that they were alive.</p>

<p>“What on earth can have happened to them?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“You’ve got me,” confessed Walt. “I can’t
imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“It’s certain that they were all right and lively
a few minutes ago,” said Ralph.</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it,” agreed Jack. “Well, then,
it must be something that they’ve eaten right
here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what?” objected Ralph Stetson.
“There’s nothing here for them to eat but this
grass.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s the grass, then. It <i>is peculiar</i>
looking grass, now you come to look at it. Look
at these funny tufts on it.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right, Walt,” agreed Jack, “but
let’s try if we can’t get the ponies on their feet.
Maybe it will work off.”</p>

<p>Not without a lot of exertion were the ponies
induced to stand up, and then they appeared to
be so sleepy that they could hardly keep their
feet.</p>

<p>“Let’s mount them and ride them up and
down,” said Jack; “that may help to work off
whatever it is that ails them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>The three lads mounted as Jack suggested and
began riding their ponies vigorously up and down
under the cottonwoods. After a short time the
treatment did appear to be effective. The
ponies’ eyes, which had been dull and lifeless,
brightened up and they shook their heads and
tossed their manes vigorously.</p>

<p>“Well, they seem to be all right again. I guess
we’d better be pushing on,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute. Let’s take some of that
grass along,” suggested Walt. “Mr. Reeves may
be able to tell us what it is.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” assented Jack.</p>

<p>Each of the boys picked a big bunch of the
queer&ndash;looking grass and stuffed it in his pocket.
Then they rode on once more, the ponies seeming
to be as well as ever after their odd sleeping
fit. It may be said here that Mr. Reeves told
them later on that the grass the ponies had eaten
was of a rare sort known as “lazy grass.” It
grows in parts of the southwest and is readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
recognizable by its peculiar tufts. It has the effect
of a narcotic, and if taken in large quantities
may prove fatal. But the ponies had only
eaten enough to make them sleepy, fortunately
for the boys.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HERMIT OF THE YUCCA.</p>

<p>Late that same afternoon the three boy travelers
found themselves riding amidst a perfect
forest of stiff&ndash;armed yucca plants. Here they
came upon a small shack where lived a strange
character of the Texan wilds. This old man was
known to the cowboys and ranchers who passed
that way as Mad Mat. He was supposed to have
been driven to the solitudes of the yucca desert
by some unfortunate love affair, but of this he
never talked, and all concerning his former life
was merely rumor.</p>

<p>Hot and dusty as the boys were, they decided
that it would be pleasant to stop in at the shack
and see if they could obtain some fresh water
and a cooked meal, for, although they had plenty
of cold grub, they had neglected to bring any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
cooking appliances. Jack knocked at the door
of the dilapidated shack and the boys, who had
not been prepared for the strange appearance of
Mad Mat, almost shrank back as he appeared.</p>

<p>The old hermit was dressed in a collection of
filthy rags, apparently secured from all sources,
for no two pieces matched. A long gray beard
hung almost to his waist, and out of the hairy
growth which half covered his face his eyes
glowed like two coals of fire. However, he did
not appear half so formidable as he looked, and
the boys concluded that the old hermit of the
yucca waste would be an interesting character
to study.</p>

<p>Mad Mat invited them cordially enough into
his shack, and opened the door to them with as
consequential a flourish of his hand as if this had
been the dwelling place of an emperor. He lived,
so he told them, by tending his little flock of
sheep, most of which, so rumor in that part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the country had it, had been stolen from passing
herds.</p>

<p>However that might be, Mad Mat was able
to set forth some excellent mutton before his
hungry guests, and, although the surroundings
were not suited to the fastidious, the boys had
roughed it too much in the southwest to be over&ndash;particular.</p>

<p>They found Mad Mat talkative on every subject
but himself. In fact, when Ralph asked him
where he came from the old man became quite
angry and glared at them out of his beard like
an “owl in an ivy bush,” as Ralph put it afterward.</p>

<p>Jack found an opportunity to draw Ralph
aside and warned him that it was not good policy
in that country to ask personal questions of
strangers.</p>

<p>“Most of these odd characters of the plains
have a reason for being out here which they
don’t like to talk about,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>By way of changing the subject, Walt turned
to that safe topic, the weather.</p>

<p>“You evidently haven’t had much rain here
lately?” he said.</p>

<p>“Nope,” rejoined Mad Mat in his odd, jerky
way of talking; “no rain. No rain for a year.”</p>

<p>“No rain for a year!” echoed the boys.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Maybe a drop now and then,
but not to amount to anything.”</p>

<p>“How do you get water then?” asked Ralph,
for the ponies had been watered from a big tub
filled from a wooden pipe.</p>

<p>“Pipe it from a dry spring.”</p>

<p>“That’s a funny sort of spring&mdash;a dry one,”
exclaimed Walt.</p>

<p>“It’s so, just the same,” replied the hermit,
rather angrily. “We call a dry spring one that
you have to dig out, one that doesn’t come to
the surface. We find ’em with divining rods.”</p>

<p>“Well, it looks to me as if you might get some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
rain to&ndash;night,” said Jack, who had risen and
looked out of the door.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” said the hermit confidently.
“The sheep ain’t baaing, and they mos’ gen’ally
always do afore rain.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s something coming up then, or
I’m no judge of weather.”</p>

<p>At the same time a low, distant rumbling was
heard.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” cried Walt, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” agreed Ralph. “I guess we
are in for a wetting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said the hermit, shrugging
his thin shoulders.</p>

<p>He rose and accompanied by Walt and Ralph
came to the door, where Jack was already
standing.</p>

<p>“Goshen!” he exclaimed, “it is makin’ up its
mind to suthin’, fer sure.”</p>

<p>Far off to the southwest lightning was ripping
and tearing in livid streaks across the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
It had grown almost as black as night, and there
was a distinctly sulphurous smell in the air.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent sight as the storm swept
down on them, although it was also awe&ndash;inspiring.
The sky grew like a black curtain spread
above the earth. Across it riven fragments of
white cloud were driven, like flying steam.
Through this sable canopy the lightning tore
and crackled with vicious emphasis.</p>

<p>But, strangely enough, there was no rain. Instead,
great clouds of dust heralded the coming
of the storm. The air was stifling and heavy,
too, like the breath from an open oven door.</p>

<p>“There ain’t much rain up yonder,” said the
old hermit, his long white hair and beard blown
about wildly by the wind.</p>

<p>“No rain?” questioned Jack. “What is there,
then?”</p>

<p>“Lightning,” exclaimed the old man, his eyes
glowing strangely as he spoke. It seemed that
he rejoiced and triumphed in the advance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
storm. He held his arms extended to the
heavens like a prophet of olden days.</p>

<p>Suddenly with an ear&ndash;splitting crash a bolt
tore its way across the sky and fell with a sizzling
crash almost in front of the shanty. It
bored into the earth, throwing up a cloud of
stones and dust on every side. So great was
the force of the explosion when it struck that
Jack was sent reeling back against the door post.</p>

<p>“No more of that for me,” said the boy. “I’m
going inside.”</p>

<p>“A lot of good that will do you,” scoffed Walt
Phelps. “It wouldn’t much surprise me if this
house was hit next.”</p>

<p>Ralph’s face turned pale as he heard. In truth
the constant display of heavenly artillery was
discomposing. A green glare lit up the surroundings,
the yuccas standing out blackly
against the constant flashes.</p>

<p>The thunder, too, was terrific and incessant,
shaking the earth as it reverberated. All at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
came a crash that seemed as if it must have
split the earth wide open. Balls of green and
white fire spattered in every direction. The boys
were hurled helter&ndash;skelter all over the hut. It
was almost pitch dark, and they called to each
other nervously. Not one knew but that the
other might have been killed or seriously injured.</p>

<p>But although bruised and badly scared, they
were all right, it was found. Yet as they scrambled
to their feet the lightning outside showed
them a still form lying across the door of the hut.</p>

<p>“It’s the hermit!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“He’s dead!” shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” warned Jack.</p>

<p>He went outside and Walt helped him drag
the old man into the hut. The lightning, by one
of those freaks for which it is noted, had stripped
his miserable collection of rags right off him and
there did not appear to be much life in him.</p>

<p>The boys laid him on a table and then lighted
a lantern, for it was too dark to see but by artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
light. All this time the storm raged and
crashed alarmingly about them, but they were
too intent on discovering a spark of life in the
old hermit to pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>“Get some water, quick!” ordered Jack.</p>

<p>There was a tub in one corner of the hut and
the boys dipped cloths into it, which Jack applied
to the base of the old man’s skull. After
a time, to Jack’s great delight, the old hermit began
to give signs of recovery. He opened his
queer, bloodshot eyes and looked up at the boys.</p>

<p>“How do you feel?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“As if I’d bin kicked by a blamed mule,” answered
Mad Mat.</p>

<p>The boys could not help laughing at his whimsical
description of the effects of the lightning.</p>

<p>“It took all the&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”&mdash;Jack hesitated as
to what to call the hermit’s rags&mdash;“the clothes
off you.”</p>

<p>“Consarn it, so it did,” grunted the old man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
sitting up. “The last time it hit me it did the
same thing.”</p>

<p>“What! Have you been hit before?” demanded
the boys in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Sure. This makes the third time, an’ I guess
as I’ve got through this safely, I’m all right
now.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s one way of looking at it,” declared
Walt with a grin, “but once would be
quite enough for me.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, it didn’t rain,” said the hermit triumphantly.
“I told yer it wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>It was all the boys could do to keep from
breaking out into hearty laughter at the strange
old man who seemed to mind being hit by lightning
no more than any ordinary occurrence.</p>

<p>“Waal, now I’ve got to stitch all them rags
together agin,” he said presently in a complaining
tone, regarding the scattered collection of
stuff that had been torn off him by the lightning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gracious! I should think you’d get a new
outfit,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>The hermit glowered at him.</p>

<p>“Git a new outfit? What’d I git a new outfit
fer? Ain’t them clothes as good as ever? All
they want is stitching together agin and they’ll
be as good as new.”</p>

<p>So saying, he went outside, for the storm had
passed over by this time, and began gathering
his scattered raiment.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better put on some clothes?” suggested
Jack, trying to stifle his laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s right!” exclaimed the hermit, who
had apparently quite forgotten that he was bereft
of all garments. He returned to the shack,
put on an old blanket, and with this wrapped
about him he set about collecting his rags once
more, grumbling to himself all the time.</p>

<p>“I s’pose that blame lightnin’ will hit one of
my sheep next trip,” he grunted, as if the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
that he had been struck was nothing compared
with the loss of one of his sheep.</p>

<p>“Speaking of sheep, we’d better go and see
how the ponies are getting along,” said Jack
presently.</p>

<p>They ran to the rough shed where the ponies
had been tied. Two of them, they found, had
been knocked down by a bolt, while the other
was half wild from fright. The two that had
been struck were just struggling to their feet.</p>

<p>The boys quieted their distressed animals and
saddled them up ready to depart from the strange
old hermit and his abode.</p>

<p>“You can’t blame the ponies for being scared,”
declared Jack with a laugh; “being knocked out
twice in one day is pretty tough.”</p>

<p>“Unless you’re a hermit,” laughed Walt, at
which they all roared.</p>

<p>Jack handed the hermit some money to pay
for their entertainment as they were leaving.
The old man took it without a word, except to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
say that he would have to hurry and stitch a
pocket on his rags so as to have some place to
put it.</p>

<p>Then, without a word of farewell, he continued
picking up his scattered raiment, and the
last the boys saw of him he was still intent on
his odd task.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">BY SHEER GRIT.</p>

<p>Owing to the delay caused by the storm, it
was late when they reached the Lagunitas
Rancho. It was too dark for them to form any
idea of the place, but Mr. Reeves, who greeted
them warmly, ushered them into a long, low
room hung with skins and trophies of the hunt,
and ornamented at one end by a huge stone fireplace.
The boys were surprised to find the ranch
very comfortably furnished, almost luxurious, in
fact. Every comfort of civilization was to be
found there, even down to a grand piano and
a phonograph. After a plentiful supper Mr.
Reeves entertained the boys with selections on
both of these instruments.</p>

<p>The rancher was married and had three children,
but his family was at the time away on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
visit to the East. Mr. Reeves said that while
he was sorry that the boys had not had an opportunity
to meet them, he was glad of their
absence in another sense, for times were very
troublous along the Border.</p>

<p>It was decided that the boys were not to go
on duty that night, but would turn in early and
spend the next day getting acquainted with the
ranch so that they could ride over it “blindfold,”
as Mr. Reeves put it. He informed them
that he had six cowboys on duty, but that two
of them were not very reliable and could not be
depended upon in an emergency.</p>

<p>“I feel much easier in my mind now that I
have three of the famous Texas Rangers to help
me out,” he said with a kindly smile.</p>

<p>“I hope we shall be able to live up to what the
name stands for,” said Jack gravely.</p>

<p>“Bravo, my lad; that’s the proper spirit,” declared
the rancher warmly.</p>

<p>The boys slept that night in a comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
furnished bedroom containing three cots. Before
daybreak they were awake and discussing the
coming day. Sunrise found them outside the
ranch house, eagerly inspecting their new surroundings.
But, early as they were, Mr. Reeves
had been up before them and was ready to show
them around.</p>

<p>“Now, you boys must each pick yourself out
a pony,” he said, leading them toward a big corral
in which several ponies were running loose.</p>

<p>“But we have our own,” objected Ralph, who
knew what western bronchos are when they are
first taken out of a corral.</p>

<p>“I know that,” responded Mr. Reeves, “but
your ponies are pretty well tuckered out after
all they went through yesterday. Fresh mounts
will be very much better.”</p>

<p>“You have some fine ones here, too,” said
Jack, who had been inspecting the twenty or
more cayuses in the corral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Lagunitas is famous for its stock,” was
the response. “Will you rope the ones you want
for yourselves, or shall I tell a puncher to do it
for you?”</p>

<p>“We’d be fine Rangers if we couldn’t rope our
own ponies,” laughed Jack.</p>

<p>So saying, he selected a rope from several
which were hanging on the corral posts. He
tried it out and found it a good, pliant bit of
rawhide. In the meantime Walt and Ralph had
each taken another “riata” and were testing
them.</p>

<p>So far as Ralph was concerned, his knowledge
of lariat throwing was strictly limited. He had
practiced a bit on the Merrill ranch, but he did
not know much about the art&mdash;for an art it is
to throw a rope with precision and accuracy.</p>

<p>By this time several of the cow&ndash;punchers attached
to the ranch had assembled and watched
the boys critically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“Watch the Tenderfeet throw a rope, Bud,”
said one of them, a short, freckle&ndash;faced fellow.</p>

<p>“Waal, I don’t know but that tall one knows
how to handle a lariat,” rejoined Bud, fixing his
eyes on Jack as he entered the corral with his
rope trailing behind him, the loop ready for a
swing. As soon as the boys were within the
corral they started “milling” the ponies, as it is
called, that is, causing them to run round and
round in circles. In this work they were aided
by the shrill whoops and yells of the cow&ndash;punchers,
who perched on the fence like a row
of buzzards.</p>

<p>A buckskin pony with a white face and pink&ndash;rimmed
eyes caught Jack’s fancy, and in a jiffy
his rope was swishing through the air. It fell
neatly about the buckskin’s neck, and Jack quickly
brought the little animal up with a round turn
on the “snubbing post” in the center of the corral.
Then came Walt’s turn and after some difficulty
he succeeded in lassoing a small but wiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
chestnut animal that looked capable of carrying
his weight finely.</p>

<p>Last of all came Ralph. He set his lips firmly
and made the best cast he knew how at a sorrel
colt that was galloping past him. The cowboys
set up a jeering yell as they saw the way he handled
his rope, and Ralph flushed crimson with
mortification. Again and again he cast his rope,
each time failing to land his animal. At last Mr.
Reeves ordered one of the punchers to catch the
pony for him. Ralph, feeling much humiliated,
saw the sorrel caught with neatness and despatch.</p>

<p>“Must have bin practicing ropin’ with yer
maw’s clothes line,” grinned the cowboy who had
effected the capture as he handed the pony over
to Ralph.</p>

<p>While this was going on Jack had secured his
heavy stock saddle and approached the buckskin
to put it on its back. But the instant the little
brute saw the saddle it began a series of wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
buckings, lashing the air frantically with its hind
feet.</p>

<p>“Now look out for fun!” yelled a cow&ndash;puncher.</p>

<p>“The kid’s got hold of old Dynamite,” laughed
another.</p>

<p>Jack heard this last remark and realized from
it that the pony he had selected was a “bad one.”
But he determined to stick it out.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeves came over to his side.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t try to ride Dynamite, my boy,” he
said. “He’s the most unruly broncho on the
ranch. Take a quieter one like your chums
have.”</p>

<p>“I like this buckskin, sir, and, if you have no
objection, I mean to ride him,” spoke Jack
quietly.</p>

<p>Something in the boy’s eye and the determined
set of his mouth and chin told the ranch owner
that it would be useless to argue with Jack.</p>

<p>“At any rate, I’ll send Bud in to help you
cinch up,” he volunteered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Jack, keeping his eyes on
the buckskin, which had his ears laid back, and
was the very picture of defiance.</p>

<p>Bud, grinning all over, came into the corral
swinging a rope. He skillfully caught the
broncho’s legs and threw the refractory animal
to the ground. The instant the pony was down
Jack ran forward and put a blindfold over his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Waal, I see you do know something,” admitted
Bud grudgingly, “but you ain’t never
goin’ ter ride Dynamite.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Cos there ain’t a puncher on this ranch kin
tackle him and I ’low no bloomin’ Tenderfoot is
going ter do what an old vaquero kain’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see,” said Jack, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>Having blindfolded the pony, a “hackamore”
bridle was slipped over his head. To this Dynamite
offered no resistance. The blindfold made
him quiet and submissive for the time being.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
When the bridle was in place he was allowed to
rise, and before the pony knew it, almost, Jack
had the saddle on his back and “cinched” up
tightly. This done, the boy threw off his hat,
drew on a pair of gloves and adjusted his heavy
plainsman’s spurs with their big, blunt rowels.</p>

<p>“All right?” grinned Bud.</p>

<p>“All right,” rejoined Jack in the same quiet
tone he had used hitherto. To judge from outward
appearances, he was as cool as ice; but inwardly
the Border Boy knew that he was in for
a big battle.</p>

<p>“Waal, good&ndash;bye, kid, we’ll hev yer remains
shipped back home,” shouted a facetious puncher
from the group perched on the fence.</p>

<p>“Dynamite ’ull send you so high you’ll get old
coming down,” yelled another.</p>

<p>“Better let the job out, kid,” said Bud. “We
don’t want to commit murder round here.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’m the best judge of that,” spoke
Jack quickly. “Get ready to cut loose that rope
when I give the word, and take the lasso off the
snubbing post.”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>This was quickly done and Dynamite stood
free, but still blindfolded. Jack poised on his tip
toes and gave a light run forward. His hands
were seen to touch the saddle and the next instant
he was in it. He leaned forward and
lifted the blindfold.</p>

<p>For an instant Dynamite stood shivering, his
ears laid back, his eyes rolling viciously. Then,
before the broncho knew what had happened,
Jack’s quirt came down on his flank heavily.</p>

<p>“Yip!” yelled the cow&ndash;punchers.</p>

<p>“Yip! Yip!” called Jack, and hardly had the
words left his mouth before he was flying
through the air over the pony’s head. Dynamite’s
first buck had unseated him. Mr. Reeves
ran forward anxiously as Jack plowed the
ground. But his anxiety was needless. By the
time he reached the boy’s side Jack was up again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
brushing the dirt of the corral from his clothing.
He was pale but determined.</p>

<p>“You see, I told you it was impossible,” said
the ranch owner. “Give it up.”</p>

<p>“Give it up!” exclaimed Jack. “Why, I’ve
only just begun.”</p>

<p>“The kid’s got grit,” exclaimed a cowboy who
had heard this last.</p>

<p>“Yep, more grit than sense, I reckon,” chimed
another.</p>

<p>Jack picked up his rope once more and recaptured
the buckskin, which was trotting about
the corral, apparently feeling that the fight was
over and he had won. Once more Bud held the
rope while Jack vaulted into the saddle.</p>

<p>This time, however, there was no preliminary
pause. Dynamite plunged straight into his program
of unseating tactics.</p>

<p>With a vicious squeal the pony’s hind feet shot
out and the next instant as Jack jerked the little
animal’s head up it caroomed into the air, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
down with a stiff&ndash;legged jolt that jarred every
nerve in Jack’s body. Then began a series of
amazing bucks. It seemed impossible that anybody,
much less a mere boy, could have stuck
to the pony’s back through such an ordeal.</p>

<p>“Wow! Dynamite’s sure steamboatin’ some!”
yelled the cow&ndash;punchers.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dynamite ceased bucking.</p>

<p>“Look out for a side&ndash;jump!” shouted Mr.
Reeves; but, even as he spoke, it came.</p>

<p>The broncho gave a brain&ndash;twisting leap to the
left, causing Jack to sway out of his saddle to the
right. Luckily he caught the pommel and cantle
just in time to save himself from being thrown.
Dynamite seemed surprised that he had not unseated
his rider by his favorite and oft&ndash;tried
method. He repeated his famous side&ndash;jump.
But Jack stuck like a cockle&ndash;burr to a colt’s tail.</p>

<p>All at once the buckskin gave a semi&ndash;turn
while in the air. It was a variation of the regular
“buck” that would have unseated half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
veteran cowboys perched on the corral fence
watching the fight between boy and broncho.</p>

<p>“Good fer you, kid!” they shouted enthusiastically,
as Jack maintained his seat.</p>

<p>“Stick to it, Jack!” chimed in the voices of
Ralph and Walt.</p>

<p>But it is doubtful if Jack heard any of the
applause. He was too busy watching Dynamite’s
antics. Suddenly the pony rushed straight
at the corral fence and tore along it as closely
as he could without cutting his hide. His object
was to scrape off the hateful human who stuck
so persistently to his back. But Jack was as
quick as the buckskin and as the pony dashed
along the fence he had one leg up over the saddle
and out of harm’s way.</p>

<p>All at once Dynamite paused. Then up went
his head, his fore feet beat the air furiously.
Straight up he reared till he was standing almost
erect. Then without the slightest warning
he toppled over backward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>A shout of alarm went up from the punchers,
but Jack did not need it. As the pony crashed
to earth Jack was not there. He had nimbly
leaped from the saddle and to one side.</p>

<p>Before the buckskin could rise again Jack was
straddling the saddle. As the animal sprang up
Jack was back in his seat once more with a sadly
perplexed broncho under him. Dynamite had
tried everything, and more too, that he had used
on the ranch riders and all had failed to remove
the incubus on his back.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Jack. You’ve finished him!”
yelled Walt Phelps.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure,” warned Mr. Reeves, who
was standing by the boys. “See the way those
ears are set? That means more trouble coming.”</p>

<p>The words had hardly left the ranch owner’s
mouth before the “trouble” came. Dynamite
darted off as if he had been impelled from a
cannon’s mouth. Then all at once he set his legs
stiff and slid along the ground, ploughing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
dusty furrows with his hoofs in the soft earth of
the corral. Had Jack not been prepared for some
such maneuver, he might have been unseated.
But he had guessed that something more was
coming off and so he was prepared. Hardly had
Dynamite come to his abrupt stop before he
threw himself on his side and rolled over. If
Jack had been there, he would have been crushed
by the pony’s weight&mdash;but he wasn’t.</p>

<p>As the pony rolled Jack stepped out of the
saddle on the opposite side. The moment he
slipped off he picked up the loose end of the
lariat which was still around the pony’s neck.</p>

<p>“Yip! Get up!” he cried.</p>

<p>Dynamite, not thinking of anything but that
he was free at last, was off like a shot. But,
alas! he reckoned without his host. As the little
animal darted off Jack took a swift turn of the
rope around the snubbing post. When Dynamite
reached the end of the rope he got the surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of his life. His feet were jerked from
under him and over he went in a heap.</p>

<p>Before he could rise Jack was over him. As
Dynamite struggled up Jack resumed his seat in
the saddle; but now he rode a different Dynamite
from the unsubdued buckskin he had roped a
short time before. Trembling in every limb,
covered with sweat and dirt, and his head hanging
down, Dynamite owned himself defeated.</p>

<p>A great shout of applause went up from the
cow&ndash;punchers and from Jack’s chums.</p>

<p>“His name ain’t Dynamite no longer; it’s
‘Sugar Candy’!” shouted an enthusiastic cow&ndash;puncher.</p>

<p>“Wow! but the kiddy is some rider,” yelled
another.</p>

<p>“You bet!” came an assenting chorus of approval.</p>

<p>“Splendid work, my boy,” approved Mr.
Reeves warmly, coming forward and shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Jack’s hand. “It was as fine an exhibition of
horsemanship and courage as ever I saw.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” laughed Jack lightly. “I’ve got an
idea that Dynamite and I are going to be great
chums. Aren’t we, little horse?”</p>

<p>Jack patted the buckskin’s sweating neck and
the pony shook his head as if he agreed with
the boy who had conquered his fighting spirit
by sheer grit.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE GREAT STAMPEDE.</p>

<p>“How is it going, Jack? All quiet?”</p>

<p>Walt Phelps paused in his ride around the
herd to address his chum.</p>

<p>“Yes, everything is going splendidly, Walt.
Dynamite’s a real cow&ndash;pony.”</p>

<p>“No doubt about that. Well, I’ll ride on; we
must keep circling the herd.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. They seem a bit restless.”</p>

<p>Walt rode off with a word of farewell, while
Jack flicked Dynamite with the quirt and proceeded
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The time was about midnight the night following
Jack’s little argument with Dynamite.
Since nine o’clock the Border Boys had been on
duty with the Reeves herd. Under the bright
stars the cattle were visible only as a black, evershifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
mass, round and round which the boys,
Bud and two cow&ndash;punchers circled unceasingly.
Some of the animals were feeding, others standing
up or moving about. The air reeked of
cattle. Their warm breaths ascended into the
cool night in a nebulous cloud of steam.</p>

<p>From far off came the sound of a voice singing,
not unmusically, that classic old ballad of
the Texas cowman:</p>

<p class="ppq8 p1">
<i>“Lie quietly now, cattle,<br />
And please do not rattle,<br />
Or else we will ‘mill’ you,<br />
As sure as you’re born.</i></p>

<p class="ppn8 p1"><i>A long time ago,<br />
At Ranch Silver Bow,<br />
I’d a sweetheart and friends,<br />
On the River Big Horn“</i></p>

<p class="p1">Jack pulled up his pony for a minute and listened
to the long drawn, melancholy cadence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
It was the cow&ndash;puncher’s way of keeping the cattle
quiet and easy&ndash;minded. Steers at night are
about as panicky creatures as can be imagined.
The rustle of the night wind in the sagebrush,
the sudden upspringing of a jackrabbit, the
whinnying of a pony, all these slight causes have
been known to start uncontrollable “stampedes“
that have been costly both to life and property.</p>

<p>The night was intensely still. Hardly a breath
of wind stirred. Except for the occasional bellow
of a restless steer or the never&ndash;ending refrain
of Bud’s song, the plains on the border of
the Rio Grande were as silent as a country
churchyard.</p>

<p>Jack resumed his ride. He began whistling.
It was not a cheerful tune he chose. “Massa’s
in the Cold, Cold Ground,” was his selection.
Somehow it seemed to the lad that such a tune
was suited to the night and to his task.</p>

<p>Jack’s course led him to the south of the herd,
between the main body of cattle and the Rio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Grande. He kept a bright lookout as he passed
along the river banks. He knew that if trouble
was coming, it was going to come from that
direction. Almost unconsciously he felt his holsters
to see if his weapons were all right.</p>

<p>Once he paused to listen. It was at a spot
right on the river bank that he made his halt.
He was just about to ride on again, whistling
his lugubrious tune, when something odd caught
his eye and set his heart to thumping violently.</p>

<p>A head covered with a white hood containing
two eyeholes had suddenly appeared above the
river bank. The next instant a score more appeared.
All wore the white hoods with the
same ghastly eyeholes, giving them the appearance
of so many skulls.</p>

<p>Greatly startled and alarmed, Jack yet realized
that the figures that had appeared so suddenly
must be those of cattle&ndash;stealing Mexican rebels
and that they had adopted the hoods with the
idea of scaring the superstitious cowboys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Hardly had he arrived at this conclusion before
the hooded horsemen rushed up the bank. They
aimed straight for the boy.</p>

<p>Instantly Jack’s hand sought his holster.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

<p>It was the three shots agreed upon as a signal
of trouble. From far back on the eastern side
of the herd came an answer. Jack had just time
to hear it when the hooded band swept down
upon him. He felt bullets whiz past his ear and
then, without exactly knowing how it happened,
he was riding for his life, crouched low on
Dynamite’s withers.</p>

<p>Off to the north, east and west other six&ndash;shooters
cracked and flashed. The signal of
alarm was being passed around rapidly. Jack
was riding for his life toward the west side of
the herd. Behind him pressed one of the hooded
horsemen. All the others had been distanced by
the fleet&ndash;footed Dynamite. But this man behind
him clung on like grim death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>From time to time he fired, but at the pace
they were going his aim was naturally poor and
none of the bullets went near the fleeing boy on
the buckskin pony.</p>

<p>The air roared in Jack’s ears as he dashed
along. All at once he became conscious of another
roar, the roar of hundreds of terrified
steers. Horns crashed and rattled. Startled bellows
arose. Then off to the east came more firing.
Jack judged by this that most of the hooded
band had gone off in that direction and were now
engaged in fighting with Bud and the rest of the
cattle watchers.</p>

<p>The next instant the lad became conscious of
a thunderous sound that seemed to shake the
earth. It was the roar and rush of thousands
of hoofs.</p>

<p>“The cattle have stampeded!” gasped Jack to
himself, and the next instant:</p>

<p>“The firing to the east has started them off;
and I am right in their path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>He swung his pony in an effort to cut off part
of the herd. But through the darkness they
thundered down on him like a huge overpowering
wave of hoofs and horns. Jack fired with
both his six&ndash;shooters, hoping to turn the stampede;
but he might as well have saved his cartridges.
No power on earth can stop stampeding
cattle till they get ready to quit.</p>

<p>Jack was in the direst peril. But he did not
lose his head. He swung Dynamite around once
more and urged him forward. It was a race for
life with the maddened cattle. He had lost all
thought of the hooded rider who had pursued
him so closely. His sole idea now was to escape
alive from the stampede behind him. Had he
dared, he would have tried to cut across the face
of it. But he knew that he stood every chance
of being trapped should he do so. He therefore
decided to trust to Dynamite’s fleetness and sure&ndash;footedness.
It made him shudder to think what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
would befall him if the pony happened to get his
foot in a gopher hole and stumble.</p>

<p>A Texas steer in a stampede can travel every
bit as fast as a pony, and it was not long before
the steers were in a crescent&ndash;shaped formation,
with Jack riding for his life in about the center
of the half moon. On and on they thundered in
the mad race. To Jack it felt as if they were
beginning to go down hill, but he was not certain.
Nor had he the least idea of the direction
in which he was going. He bent all his faculties
on keeping ahead of that hoofed and horned
wave behind him.</p>

<p>Dynamite went like the wind. But even his
muscles began to flag under the merciless strain
after a time. He felt the effects of his strenuous
lesson of the morning. Jack was forced to
ply quirt and spur to keep him on his gait. But
the signs that the pony was playing out dismayed
the boy. His life depended on Dynamite’s staying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
powers, and they were only too plainly diminishing.</p>

<p>The slope down which they were dashing was
a fairly steep one, which accounted for Jack’s
feeling the grade. It led into a broad, sandy&ndash;bottomed,
dry water course, or “arroyo” as they
are called in the west. But of this, of course,
Jack was unaware.</p>

<p>All at once Jack felt Dynamite plunge into a
thick patch of grease&ndash;wood. The pony slowed
up as he encountered the obstruction, but Jack’s
quirt and spur urged him into it. But that momentary
pause had been nearly fatal. Jack
could now almost feel the hot breath of the leading
cattle. Despite his grit and courage, both
of sterling quality, Jack’s heart gave an uncomfortable
bound. He felt his scalp tighten at the
narrowness of his escape. But still he urged
Dynamite on. Luckily he wore stout leather
“chaps,” or the brush would have torn his limbs
fearfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Dynamite tore on, with seemingly undiminished
valor, but Jack knew that the end was near.</p>

<p>“Only a few yards more, and then&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;” he
thought, when he felt a different sensation.</p>

<p>It filled him with alarm. He was dropping
downward through the air. Down he plunged,
while behind him came the thunder of the maddened
steers.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Is this the end?” was the
thought that flashed through the boy’s mind in
that terrible fraction of time when he felt himself
and his pony dropping through space.</p>

<p>The next instant he felt the pony hit the
ground under him. Like a stone from a slingshot,
Jack was catapulted out of the saddle. He
landed on the ground some distance from the
pony. He was shaken and bruised, but he was
up in a flash. In another instant the steers would
be upon him. He would be crushed to a pulp
under their hoofs unless he found some means
of escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I don’t do something quick, it’s good&ndash;bye
for me,” he told himself.</p>

<p>In frantic haste he looked about for some
means of saving himself. All at once he spied
through the darkness the black outlines of a cottonwood
tree. In a flash his plan was formed.
He slipped behind the trunk of the cottonwood,
using it as a shield between himself and the oncoming
cattle.</p>

<p>Hardly had he slipped behind his refuge when
an agonized cry came to his ears, the cry of a
human being in mortal terror. Jack peered from
behind his tree trunk. As he did so the form
of a man rolled almost to his feet and lay still.</p>

<p>With a thrill Jack recognized the white hood
the figure wore and knew it must be the hooded
horseman who had pursued him. Like himself,
the man had been caught in the stampede and
been thrown from his horse almost at the foot
of the tree. Exerting all his strength, Jack
pulled the man into shelter behind the tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
scarcely a second before the crazed steers were
upon them. In their blind frenzy of terror many
of them dashed headlong into the tree, stunning
and killing themselves. But the main herd swept
by on both sides, leaving Jack and the unconscious
man in a little haven of safety behind the
tree trunk.</p>

<p>Jack found himself wedged in between two
barricades of bellowing, galloping steers, and for
his deliverance from what had seemed certain
death a few minutes before he offered up a fervent
prayer of thanks.</p>

<p>For some time the rush continued and then
thinned out to a few stragglers. At last Jack
thought it safe to emerge from behind his tree.
In front of it lay several dead cattle, their brains
knocked out by the force with which they had
collided with the cottonwood. A few injured
animals limped about moaning piteously. Some
of them were so badly injured that Jack, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
could not bear to see an animal suffer, put them
out of their misery with his six&ndash;shooter.</p>

<p>It was now time to turn his attention to the
hooded man. The fellow had been stunned when
he was thrown from his horse; but he was now
stirring and groaning. Jack bent over him and
pulled off his hood. As he did so he staggered
back with an amazed exclamation.</p>

<p>The face the starlight revealed was that of
Alvarez, the man whose destiny had been so
oddly linked with Jack’s!</p>

<p>“Where am I? What has happened?” exclaimed
the man in Spanish as he opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>“’You have been engaged in the despicable
work of cattle stealing, Alvarez,” spoke Jack
sternly. “If you had not been thrown at my
very feet, you would have perished miserably
under the hoofs of the herd you planned to steal.”</p>

<p>At the first sound of Jack’s voice Alvarez had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
staggered painfully to his feet. Now he uttered
a cry.</p>

<p>“It is you, Señor Merrill! I thought you were
miles from here.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am not, as you see. Are you badly
hurt?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. I think my arm is broken.
It pains fearfully.”</p>

<p>“I will examine it by daylight. Are you
armed?”</p>

<p>“I was, señor, but I lost my pistol in that fearful
ride before the stampede.”</p>

<p>The man’s tone was cringing, whining almost.
Jack felt nothing but contempt for him. He held
that the Mexican revolutionists were about as
much in the right as the government troops; but
cattle stealing on the Border is a serious offense
and Jack Merrill was a rancher’s son. He made
no reply to Alvarez, but, telling him to remain
where he was, he went off to see if he could find
some water to bathe the man’s injuries, for, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
his injured arm, he had a nasty cut on
the head.</p>

<p>He did not find water and was returning to
the tree rather downcast, when through the
darkness ahead of him he saw something moving.
The object was not a steer, he was sure of
that. He moved cautiously toward it, his heart
beating with a hope he hardly dared to entertain.</p>

<p>But at last suspicion grew to certainty.</p>

<p>“It’s my pony! It’s Dynamite!” he breathed,
not daring to make a noise lest the pony take
fright and dash off.</p>

<p>Cautiously he crept up on the little animal. He
now saw as he drew closer that another horse
was beside it. He had no doubt that this latter
beast was the one Alvarez had ridden. How the
horses had escaped death or serious injury Jack
could not imagine; but escape it they had, although
they both stood dejectedly with heads
hung down and heaving flanks.</p>

<p>“Whoa, Dynamite! Whoa, boy!” whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Jack, moving up to the broncho with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>Dynamite stirred nervously. He pricked up
his ears. Jack crept forward once more. In this
way he got within a few feet of the pony. Then
he decided to make a dash for it. He flung himself
forward, grabbed the pommel of the saddle
and swung himself on to Dynamite’s back. With
a squeal of fear the pony started bucking
furiously.</p>

<p>“Buck all you want,” laughed Jack. “I’ve got
you now and, by ginger, if I can do it, I mean to
get back those cattle, too.”</p>

<p>Dynamite soon quieted down and then Jack
set himself to catching the horse Alvarez had
ridden. This was not an easy task, but the brute
was not so fiery as Dynamite, and at last Jack
got him. The dawn was just flushing up in the
east when Jack, leading the Mexican’s horse, rode
back toward the cottonwood tree. Alvarez, looking
pale and old, sat where Jack had left him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>He glanced up as the boy approached, but said
nothing. Jack hitched the horses and then examined
the Mexican’s arm. He decided that it was
not broken, only badly sprained. He concluded,
therefore, that the Mexican was quite able to
perform the task he had laid out for him.</p>

<p>“Get on your horse, Alvarez,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“Si, señor,” rejoined the swarthy Alvarez
without comment.</p>

<p>Only when he was mounted and Jack told him
to ride in front of him, did he inquire what was
to be done with him.</p>

<p>“You are going to help me drive those cattle
back first,” said Jack grimly. “Then we’ll decide
on what comes next.”</p>

<p>In silence they rode up the far bank of the
arroyo and the plain lay spread out before them.
Jack could not restrain a cry of joy as in the
distance he saw a dark mass closely huddled. It
was the missing band of steers.</p>

<p>“Now, Alvarez,” he warned sternly, “what will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
happen to you may depend on just how we restore
his property to Mr. Reeves. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Si, señor,” nodded the man, whose spirit appeared
completely broken.</p>

<p>They rode up cautiously. But the steers appeared
to be as quiet as so many sheep and merely
eyed them as they approached. The animals
were in pitiful shape after their frantic gallop
and one look at them showed Jack that he would
have no trouble in driving them back to the home
ranch once they were got moving.</p>

<p>Keeping a sharp eye on Alvarez, he ordered
the Mexican to begin “milling” the steers, that
is, riding them around and around till they were
bunched in a compact mass. This done, the drive
began. At times Jack hardly knew how he kept
in his saddle. He was sick, faint, and thirsty,
with a burning thirst. The dust from the trampling
steers enveloped him, stinging nostrils and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
eyes, and, besides all this, he dared not take his
eyes off Alvarez for an instant.</p>

<p>The boy surveyed himself. He was a mass of
scratches and bruises, his shirt was ripped and
hung in shreds, his chaperajos alone remained
intact. Even his saddle was badly torn, and, as
for the poor buckskin, he was in as bad shape
as his master.</p>

<p>“Well, I am a disreputable looking object,”
thought the boy. “The Rangers wouldn’t own
me if they could see me now.”</p>

<p class="ls1 large">********</p>

<p>It was late afternoon at the Reeves ranch
when Bud and the two boys rode in with the
news that they could find no trace of the missing
cattle. Nor, of course, had they any news
of Jack. Mr. Reeves was much downcast at this,
almost as much so as Walt and Ralph. Yet
somehow the two latter felt sure that Jack would
come out all right.</p>

<p>They had not had an easy night of it, either.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
The battle to the eastward of the herd that had
started the stampede had resulted in a flesh
wound for Walt and a bad cut on the hand for
Ralph. But the boys and the cow&ndash;punchers had
managed to make prisoners of ten of the hooded
Mexicans, so that they felt they had not done a
bad night’s work. If only they had possessed a
clew to Jack’s fate, they would, in fact, have
been jubilant. Ralph’s behavior during the fight
had quite won him back the respect he had lost
by his poor exhibition with the rope. The Border
Boys were declared “the grittiest ever” by
every puncher on the range.</p>

<p>The ten prisoners were confined in the barn,
but they all denied vigorously having seen anything
of Jack. They confessed that their raid
had been made for the purpose of getting beef
for the rebel army, which had been practically
starved out by the government troops.</p>

<p>Bud had just dismounted by the corral and
Walt and Ralph were dispiritedly doing the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
when Mr. Reeves uttered a shout and pointed to
the far southwest.</p>

<p>“Wonder what that is off there, that cloud of
dust!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I’ll get the glasses, boss,” declared Bud.</p>

<p>He dived into the house and speedily reappeared
with a pair of powerful binoculars such
as most stockmen use.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeves applied them to his eyes and gazed
long and carefully at the distant object that had
attracted his attention.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Bud.</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. I can’t see for dust. But
I’m pretty sure it’s a band of cattle.”</p>

<p>Walt and Ralph held their breaths.</p>

<p>“<i>Our</i> cattle?” almost whispered Bud, in a tense
voice.</p>

<p>“I can’t be sure. It might be any band of
steers crossing the state. Tell you what, Bud,
saddle the big sorrel for me and we’ll go and
find out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the band of horsemen was
riding at top speed toward the distant moving
objects. As they drew closer it was seen that
they were unmistakably cattle. All at once Bud
gave a sharp cry.</p>

<p>“Boss, they’re our cows. See the big muley
steer in front? That’s old Abe. I’d know him
among a thousand.”</p>

<p>“By George, Bud, you’re right! But who can
be driving them?”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a mighty shout from
Ralph Stetson.</p>

<p>“It’s Jack!” he cried.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> the broncho bustin’ Tenderfoot as sure
as you’re a foot high!” bawled out Bud.</p>

<p>“But who’s that with him?” demanded Walt.</p>

<p>“Dunno; looks like a greaser,” growled Bud,
who had no liking for the “brown brothers”
across the Border.</p>

<p>And then, at the risk of starting another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
stampede, the cavalcade dashed forward, waving
their hats and yelling like wild Indians.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeves rode right down on Jack.</p>

<p>“Boy, you’re a wonder. How did you do it?
No; stop; don’t tell me now. I can see you’re
about tuckered out. How are you?”</p>

<p>“Roasted out,” rejoined Jack with an attempt
at a smile. But his voice was hoarse as a crow’s
and his lips were too baked and cracked to smile
naturally.</p>

<p>“Great heavens, boy, you’ve been through an
awfully tough ordeal, I can see that. But who
is this personage here?”</p>

<p>Mr. Reeves indicated Alvarez, who shrank under
his gaze.</p>

<p>Jack forced his voice out of his parched throat.</p>

<p>“That is my assistant driver, Mr. Reeves,” he
said. “We have had a good deal of talk as we
came along and he tells me that he has a great
longing to go back to his own country and <i>stay
there</i>. He knows what it means if he comes back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
across the Border again, don’t you, Alvarez?”</p>

<p>“Si, Señor Merrill,” stammered the Mexican
while Bud glowered at him.</p>

<p>“There’s something behind all this, Jack, that
I can partly guess at,” declared Mr. Reeves, “but
if you really want him to go, let him go.”</p>

<p>“You hear?” croaked Jack in Spanish.</p>

<p>“Si, señor.”</p>

<p>“Then go.”</p>

<p>The Mexican wheeled his horse, doffed his
peaked hat in a graceful wave and in a loud,
clear voice shouted:</p>

<p>“Adios, señors!”</p>

<p>He struck his spurs home and brought down
his quirt. His horse sprang forward. Straight
for the Rio Grande he rode and vanished over its
northern bank. Five minutes later he was off
American soil. On the opposite bank he paused
once more, wheeled his horse and waved his sombrero
in token of farewell. Then he vanished,
so far as the boys were concerned, forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, forward,” cried Mr. Reeves. “Bud,
you hold the cattle here till I send out some boys
to help you bring them in. Jack, you come with
us at once. You need doctoring up.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I stay and bring the cattle in?” pleaded
Jack.</p>

<p>“Son,” said the rancher in a deep voice,
“you’ve <i>done</i> your duty; mine begins now. I
haven’t heard your story yet, but I’ll bet my last
dollar that you’ve done a big thing out there, and
that the Rangers will be mighty proud of their
boy recruits.”</p>

<p>And then they rode forward to the ranch
house and food and drink, and later to the unfolding
of Jack’s story.</p>

<p>As Mr. Reeves had prophesied, the Rangers
were proud of their young comrades. And not
only the circle of Rangers, but the whole state of
Texas rang with their praises until the boys
were afraid to look at a newspaper. As for
Jack’s generous action in letting Alvarez go free,
none but Captain Atkinson, Mr. Reeves and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Border Boys themselves knew of it, though Bud
suspected, or “suspicioned” as he called it.</p>

<p>A few days later the revolution was crushed,
and they heard afterward that Alvarez had died
fighting bravely for what he deemed the right
cause. A few days later, too, the boys had to
leave their kind Texan friends and wend their
way homeward.</p>

<p>And now we, too, have reached the parting of
the ways so far as this part of the Border Boys’
adventures is concerned. Here, for a time, we
will take leave of our young friends, wishing
them well till we meet them again in further
stirring adventures. What befell them after
leaving Texas and how they acquitted themselves
in scenes and situations as exciting and thrilling
as any through which they have yet passed, will
all be related in the next volume of this series,
which will be called: “<span class="smcap">The Border Boys in

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
